"Yeah, the Jack Carr one was pretty fun.
",3
"He's super nice.
",3
"He seems like a really intriguing dude.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"So, yeah.
",1
"And he's everywhere now.
",3
"I mean, I see him all over the place.
",3
"Everywhere, yeah.
",1
"Yeah.
",1
"Yeah, really authentic and it's funny because he's very strategic about like his life plan.
",3
"Oh, really?
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Which is probably more strategic than anyone I've ever met because I asked him like if
",3
"he ever planned on having a famous like Amazon show come out about his book.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Yeah.
",1
"It was part of the plan the whole time.
",3
"Seriously?
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Holy cow.
",3
"You know that?
",4
"We're like, did you ever think you'd find Chris Pratt to play the leading role?
",3
"He's like, yeah, I knew it was going to be him the whole time.
",4
"Holy cow.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Wow.
",3
"Is it out yet?
",3
"I haven't seen it.
",3
"I think it's coming out in July.
",3
"I'm looking forward to watching it.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"It's going to be awesome.
",3
"The books were good.
",3
"So, yeah.
",1
"Yeah.
",1
"Yeah, the detail in them is pretty amazing.
",3
"Absolutely.
",3
"It's just a cool story that I did that.
",3
"How he got into it after a career in NSW.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"All the like detail he was able to do.
",3
"Well, I'm not surprised now here what you told me about his strategic plan.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"I wish I was so strategic because it wasn't that at all.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Yeah.
",1
"Some of his buddies say like they think he was a seal just so he had all the details
",3
"to write really good books.
",3
"Like he's that detailed that that was part of his plan.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"To have.
",3
"Sounds like it was.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"Sounds like it was.
",3
"Pretty wild.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"That's pretty cool.
",3
"So, let's start with your story.
",3
"What was your childhood like?
",3
"Where'd you come from?
",3
"Where'd you grow up?
",3
"I'm a Montana kid.
",3
"I grew up in Butte, Montana.
",3
"West of Bozeman here.
",3
"You know, came from pretty humble beginnings.
",4
"My dad was a ranch ham when he met my wife.
",3
"He grew up out in the Ruby Valley.
",3
"My family's been out there for five generations.
",3
"Met my mom on a blind date.
",3
"They got married and then he moved to Butte and started working in the mine.
",3
"Was an underground miner initially.
",3
"And worked for them his entire career.
",3
"You know, started out underground and then went to school.
",4
"Ultimately became a chemist and then worked in the laboratory doing assays on all the
",3
"samples from the mine.
",3
"So it started pretty humble beginnings.
",3
"You know, was a typical kid.
",4
"You know, I wasn't, I was, I tell everybody, you know, I didn't start out as an athlete.
",4
"You know, I was a, I had a good life despite our humble beginnings and really found sports,
",4
"things like that later about my freshman year in high school.
",3
"And that really put me on a trajectory to, to ultimately, you know, I think joining the
",4
"Marine Corps, things like that.
",0
"Started martial arts when I was younger.
",3
"Ultimately got into sports and really, really got a lot out of that.
",3
"Graduated from Butte High was a football athlete.
",3
"You know, had a couple of great seasons with the Butte High Bulldogs.
",4
"Although we lost our state championship in the junior and senior year, it was tough,
",3
"but it was still a great experience and really, you know, made high school what it was for me.
",4
"And then got recruited by Coach Green at Montana Tech to walk on to the football team.
",3
"It wasn't good enough to get a scholarship, but he called me in the summer and asked me to
",3
"walk on.
",3
"I'd already planned to go to Montana Tech for college.
",3
"Started out as a computer science major, ultimately ended up switching over to engineering.
",3
"The diggers, huh?
",3
"Yeah, yeah.
",1
"And Coach Green was a big influence.
",3
"You know, he was a, he was a Vietnam Marine, was a radio operator in Vietnam.
",0
"And that plays a part in my story a little bit later.
",3
"But, you know, originally my plan was to never leave Montana.
",4
"I love where I came from.
",3
"Ultimately was going to, you know, get an engineering degree and find a way to stay here
",4
"in Montana working.
",3
"But I'd always, I'd always admired the Marine Corps, always felt the need to serve.
",0
"And honestly, it was a conversation that I had with a friend about halfway through my
",3
"senior year in college.
",3
"You know, I've been talking about the Marine Corps a lot and this friend finally told me,
",0
"you know what, you need to stop talking about it and do something about it.
",4
"Just do it.
",3
"Crazy.
",3
"So I did.
",3
"I called the officer selection officer and told him I was interested in joining the Marine Corps.
",0
"This was pre-911.
",3
"So it was a, it was a long process to get in the Marine Corps at that time.
",0
"I ultimately went on and graduated from Tech.
",3
"Had to make the decision if I was going to, you know, hang around and be waiting for the
",4
"Marine Corps to call or if I'd take a job.
",0
"I'd been offered a job as an engineer in Long Beach, California.
",3
"So chemical engineering degree?
",3
"Environmental engineering.
",3
"Yeah. So took the, took the job while I was waiting on the Marine Corps, moved down to
",0
"Long Beach, California.
",3
"I remember my first flight on an airplane was when I flew down to Long Beach to, for the
",3
"interview.
",3
"First flight ever.
",3
"First flight ever.
",3
"Never been on an airplane prior to that.
",3
"And then moved from Butte, Montana, 30,000 people to Los Angeles County, 11 million people.
",3
"Pretty, pretty big culture shock.
",3
"Yeah.
",1
"It had a desk job.
",3
"I mean, I was working on the 11th floor of a tower in downtown,
",3
"downtown Long Beach, California.
",3
"We're in a suit and tie care in a briefcase.
",3
"You know, all with the promise that if the Marine Corps didn't work out, the company that I
",0
"worked for, you know, told me they'd work to get me back to Alaska or something like that.
",4
"Because they knew that Long Beach wasn't my, wasn't my jam.
",4
"
",3
"Nine months into that, the Marine Corps finally called and said, yep, we'll take you.
",0
"So I called my parents and told them I was quitting my engineering job and going to
",3
"Oxford Canada school.
",3
"They both thought I was crazy.
",3
"Wasn't sure, you know, if I was doing the right thing.
",4
"And my plan was I was going to do four years in the Marine Corps and then come back to Montana,
",0
"get a master's in geological engineering and stay in Montana again.
",3
"That was 27, 28 years ago now.
",3
"So I went in for four years, ultimately I ended up staying for just under 27.
",3
"Was your family like grandfathers in the military?
",3
"I had some great uncles that served in World War II.
",3
"I had an uncle that did a brief stint in the Army, but that was about it.
",3
"It wasn't part of my family history really.
",3
"My dad couldn't serve because he had a physical disability in his arm.
",3
"Something that he told me he always wanted to do, but he couldn't.
",3
"But no, like I said, I remember being like nine years old, just admiring the Marine Corps.
",0
"And then like I said, if you know, that friend finally convinced me that if I didn't do it,
",4
"I'd probably regret it.
",3
"
",3
"You know, so once again, you know, planning one for four years.
",4
"You know, every, every Marine has the same experience.
",0
"You go through Oxford Canada school or another commissioning program like ROTC, something like that.
",3
"Then you'll all officers end up at the basic school, which is a six-month course that every
",3
"officer in the Marine Corps goes through regardless of what their specialty is going to be.
",0
"And it's all about training you to be an infantry platoon commander.
",2
"And it's really that, you know, that experience that I think gives a Marine Corps
",0
"the esprit and camaraderie that we have.
",3
"Everybody has that shared experience on the enlisted side as well with basic training
",3
"and then Marine combat training.
",0
"So got through the basic school, went through the infantry officers course.
",3
"Was in a new military occupational specialty that they just established in the Marine Corps
",0
"called Ground Intel.
",3
"And the idea, it was based on the lessons learned from the Gulf War,
",3
"where they needed their intel officers to have more of an operational focus.
",3
"So we went to the infantry officer course first, then we went to Intel school,
",3
"and then we'd go and we'd serve as a platoon commander in an infantry battalion.
",2
"With the idea that we'd eventually progress into ground reconnaissance and then do
",3
"intel intelligence staff jobs along the way.
",3
"So I went from school to first battalion, first Marines,
",2
"did a couple deployments on naval shipping.
",3
"This was prior to 9-11.
",3
"So we were deploying overseas for presence in a training with partners.
",2
"Did two six-month deployments at sea like that.
",3
"Came back and that was the end of my four years.
",3
"And once again, that plan was I was going to get out, but, you know,
",4
"the Marine Corps offered me an opportunity to go be an instructor.
",0
"What year was this?
",3
"This was 1999.
",3
"Okay.
",3
"Offered me an opportunity to be an instructor.
",3
"I thought that sounds pretty interesting.
",3
"I think I'll give that a shot.
",3
"So I did and about a year into that instructor job in an army school,
",3
"the Marine Corps decided that they were going to stand up their own course,
",0
"ground intelligence officer course.
",3
"And I raised my hand and said, I'll do that.
",3
"So they picked me.
",3
"I moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, and, you know,
",4
"spent the next seven months standing up this military occupational specialty course for new
",3
"officers.
",3
"Writing all the curriculum had one other captain that was working with me.
",3
"And then I was a course director for that course for two years.
",3
"And then just like before, you know, thinking about getting out,
",4
"I remember writing in my journal about getting ready to come home in Montana.
",3
"And the Marine Corps offered me another opportunity to go to First Reconnaissance
",0
"Battalion.
",2
"There's no promise that you'll be a company commander, but there's an opportunity.
",2
"Yeah, that sounds great.
",1
"So I just got married.
",3
"And I remember driving across the country from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Camp Pendleton,
",3
"California.
",3
"My new wife, Marianne, asked me, so you think you're ever going to deploy?
",2
"I'm like, well, you know, I'm going to an independent battalion.
",4
"That battalion typically deploys platoons.
",2
"This was pre-911.
",3
"But close, right?
",3
"Getting close.
",3
"Getting really close.
",3
"This was 2001, July 2001.
",3
"This battalion typically deploys the platoons.
",2
"And, you know, the only time that I'd really deploy, because I'm more senior than I'd be
",2
"a platoon commander, is if the whole battalion deploys.
",2
"And the only time the whole battalion is going to deploy is if the whole division deploys.
",2
"And that's really unlikely.
",3
"
",3
"This was, you know what, four months before 9-11.
",4
"Crazy.
",3
"
",3
"So 9-11 changed all that.
",3
"As you know, ultimately I ended up deploying as a company commander.
",2
"I'd stood up, Charlie Company, First Reconnaissance Battalion.
",2
"This was a company that had been deactivated years and years ago.
",2
"As part of the growth in the Marine Corps, they were growing reconnaissance.
",0
"Standing up this company was one of those opportunities that I had.
",2
"So I had the really unique opportunity to build the team from the ground level.
",3
"Get that company ready to deploy and then lead them in combat in OF-1 during the march up.
",2
"And I'll be honest, I think that that was my best self as a leader as a company commander then.
",2
"On the ground.
",3
"On the ground, you know, an organization that I'd stood up from the ground level.
",4
"And, you know, we spent about five and a half months deployed in OF-1.
",2
"You know, as you know, the ground war went pretty quick.
",4
"And my company was most often the main effort in the battalion,
",2
"which really gave me a lot of pride because I knew how hard the Marines have worked.
",4
"You know, and to become really good at aircraft.
",4
"And then on the Marine Corps plan, once the ground war was over,
",0
"Marine Corps tapping out, we don't do counter-insurgency.
",0
"We're going home and we're going to get ready for the next one.
",3
"So on the redeployment back, our battalion operations officer had orders and he had to leave.
",2
"So I moved up from being a company commander to being the operations officer in the battalion,
",2
"redeployed him home.
",3
"And then, you know, even though we were initially told we weren't going back about three months
",4
"after we got back, hey, you're going back again in six months.
",3
"So we're getting ready to deploy back to Fallujah to run a counter-insurgency operations in and
",2
"around Fallujah. My wife was nine months pregnant that day I deployed.
",2
"So I met my oldest son when he was six months old when I got back from that deployment.
",3
"Crazy. Yeah.
",1
"The really great thing about it is I have a picture of meeting him for the first time,
",3
"which is in my calling.
",3
"Six months.
",3
"Six months. So, you know, did that deployment, OIF-2,
",4
"you know, we were trying to figure it out just like everybody else when it came to counter-insurgency.
",4
"The things in Iraq were getting pretty bad at the time, as I'm sure you can recall.
",3
"You know, Fallujah blew up while we were there.
",4
"And ultimately ended up losing a Marine and, you know, several Marines getting wounded pretty
",0
"seriously in an ambush. The Marine that was killed was, his name was Captain Brett Morell.
",0
"This was a guy that I taught as an instructor. I remember when he came to the school, you know,
",4
"he had guns and he didn't want to store them on base. He brought the guns over my house to store them.
",3
"So I knew this kid from, you know, his very beginnings in the Marine Corps.
",0
"Crazy.
",3
"Ultimately, he ended up recruiting them into First Reconnaissance Battalion. He was on the
",2
"Division of Staff and I recognized what he had, pulled them over to the battalion, got him an
",2
"opportunity to be a platoon commander, and he deployed leading that platoon in Bravo Company,
",2
"First Reconnaissance Battalion. And then, like I said, Auto Patrol is basically the scout effort
",2
"for a company that was moving from our forward operating base to a temporary fob.
",3
"And it ended up coming into an ambush. First vehicle got nailed by a machine gun fire and
",3
"rocket propelled grenades. Brett was the second vehicle in the convoy, told his driver to come
",3
"to a halt, grabbed the Marines and his vehicle and sprinted over the berm into the teeth of the
",3
"fire, took around ultimately through the lower abdomen, ultimately ended up dying.
",3
"Crazy.
",3
"Given the part that I played and getting Brent to First Reconnaissance Battalion,
",2
"that's always, that's been one of those tough things for me. So that's the bracelet that I
",3
"wear today. But got through that deployment and then the rest of my Marine Corps career went
",0
"similarly. They kept offering opportunities. I kept saying, yeah, that sounds pretty neat.
",3
"You know, I was, I went from being an operations officer to, I got an assignment at the Pentagon
",4
"where I was responsible for all the ground reconnaissance capability and the Marine Corps
",0
"capability development. So thinking like a program manager for the Marine Corps,
",0
"ground reconnaissance capability. Did that for three years, learned a ton. One of those experiences
",3
"that you're really glad you did it, but you're really glad it's over because working in the
",3
"Pentagon can be a drag for a while. Went from there to, you know, at the Naval War College,
",4
"spent a year studying as a student, getting a master's degree, which was a great opportunity
",3
"for me and my young family. Went from there back to First Marine Division, did some time as a
",0
"staff and then ultimately was selected to command First Reconnaissance Battalion Commander.
",2
"Crazy. Deployed back to Afghanistan with them. What year was that? That was 2012. Okay. 2012. So
",2
"I deployed a year prior to that with the Division staff. So I'd spent a year in Afghanistan as a
",2
"staff officer and then ultimately brought them back as a battalion commander. Through about just
",2
"shorter six month deployment, this was the end of the surge. So President Obama was starting to
",3
"pull people home. We were one of those units that were redeployed early. Ultimately ended
",3
"up leaving a company and the rest of my battalion deployed after, redeployed after about five months.
",2
"But we started out as battle space owners in the Sangan Valley. The battalion that proceeded us,
",3
"Third Reconnaissance Battalion was there during the height of the fight and they really,
",2
"they drove the enemy out of the area of operations that we got assigned. So it was a
",3
"relatively benign AO. We spent a lot of time building capacity within the local government,
",3
"trying to tie the locals to the government. Then ultimately halfway through our deployment got
",3
"pulled out, got sent back down to Camp Leatherneck. We started conducting long range raids for the
",3
"division into areas that typically didn't have any any coalition force presence. So
",3
"we'd work up an area for about a week and conduct the hellbore raid. Just go in there and really
",3
"conduct, try to disrupt the enemies, whether it was a rat lines or other operations that they had
",3
"going on, picking fights and then extracting after about a week. And that's how the battalion
",2
"finished this deployment. Went from there back to the joint staff as a Lieutenant Colonel. And
",3
"I'd originally been assigned to go to the White House to be on the national security staff.
",3
"Ultimately that didn't work out, but that process got drug out so long that by the time the
",3
"Marine Corps decided that they were going to change my orders, it was like the end of July.
",0
"I graduated from the Army War College in May. Crazy. So they moved me to Washington, D.C.
",3
"and just had me kind of just marking time, waiting for the slot on the national security staff to
",3
"open up. Finally by the end of July, they called me and said, we're going to combat on this.
",3
"What do you want to do? The military moves in seasons, people start moving early spring.
",3
"Most of the moves are done by mid-summer. So I'm like, well, what's left? Because everybody's already
",3
"moved. And my assignments officer told me, there's a job in the operations director
",3
"of the joint staff, you're already in D.C. I'm like, okay, I'll take that. That sounds pretty good.
",3
"So next day, went in and reported on the joint staff. And I remember
",3
"checking in and there's an Air Force Chief Foreign Officer there at the Joint Staff
",3
"Personnel Office and tells me, you're not going to the G3. You're going to the
",3
"Chairman's Office of Re-Integration. I'm like, what's that? He's like, I don't know. But here's
",4
"your boss's number. You give him a call and he'll tell you. So my boss was a guy on Army
",3
"crew by the name Eisenhower. So I called him and he explained to me that this was an office that
",3
"the chairman, Admiral Mullen, stood up when he was the chairman with the intent for it to lead
",3
"the DUD's efforts to help transition military service members and veterans reintegrate back
",3
"into society. He had saw all of these nonprofits, all these corporations doing a lot to try to help
",3
"veterans return to civilian society after war. But he didn't see the Department of Defense
",3
"doing a lot. So he stood up this office within his office of the chairman, put five field grade
",3
"officers in it and said, your job is to create effective reintegration pathways for veterans.
",3
"When I first heard this, I was like, whoa, this is so far from anything I've ever done.
",3
"Yeah. I started, I went home and I called the, you know, I called some mentors. I called a couple
",3
"general officers. And basically they straightened me out. They said, you know what Brian, I understand
",4
"your concerns, but you need to boom where you're planning. So I went back the next day with the
",3
"intent to do that. And it ended up being, you know, life changing event for me. Number one, it was
",4
"incredibly meaningful experience working with all these nonprofit organizations, all these
",3
"corporations trying to help veterans reintegrate and the opportunity to interact with thousands
",3
"and thousands of veterans that were going through this really challenging transition process.
",3
"So I learned a ton, did that for three years. Ultimately ended up getting orders from there
",3
"because it was a brand new colonel got promoted right at the end of that tour.
",3
"Was a brand new colonel, the, you know, the little guy on the, on the totem pole goes where
",4
"everybody else doesn't want to go. I got orders to do Okinawa, Japan, third brain division.
",3
"And my wife and I struggled with that a little bit because, you know,
",4
"it was a tough time. My father just died and my wife's family, my wife's family couldn't travel
",3
"overseas for a bunch of different reasons. So like three years away, this is a really bad time.
",3
"But ultimately we decided it was the right thing to do. And I told them, I told the assignment's
",3
"officer, we're in, let's go. So we deployed on what was going to be a three year tour to
",2
"to Okinawa, Japan with, with third brain division. And the day I was unpacking my household goods,
",3
"I got a call that I've been selected for command to command the Marine Raider Training Center at
",0
"Marsock and I'd be going home in nine months. What was supposed to be a three year tour and
",3
"being about a 10 month tour. It was still a great tour. Third brain division was an awesome place
",3
"to be. Great, great division commanders and really great tight staff and really busy because
",2
"they're training all the time in Japan, Japan. Yeah. Was an awesome experience, probably the
",3
"best staff that I was on by far. But 10 months later deployed, you know, redeployed back home
",2
"to Marine Special Operations Command. So the first day that I ever spent a day serving the Marine
",0
"Special Operations Command was the day I took command in one of its major subordinate elements.
",3
"So a pretty daunting task as you can imagine. Opportunity to interact with a guy who ultimately
",3
"ended up being a really good friend of mine, another colonel that I'd met at the command
",3
"courses. I was getting ready. He'd been in Marine Special Operations Command from the beginning.
",0
"And he basically told me you're going to have a mutiny on your hands because he got,
",3
"you know, you're this outsider. And that kind of really shaped the way that I decided to take
",4
"command. And why were you considered an outsider? Because I'd not, this was, this was at the time
",3
"where Marine Special Operations Command had its assessment and selection process established.
",0
"Everybody that came into the, into the Mars Lock at that point were being assessed and selected.
",3
"They'd come in through the process. You know, I was a reconnaissance Marine. Gotcha. Didn't have
",0
"the Marine Special Operations MOS, but it ultimately had been selected to command this training unit.
",0
"Which makes sense given my background. But he just thought that that would be a problem.
",3
"Ultimately, that didn't be the case. That wasn't the case. You know, I was,
",4
"I was pretty deliberate about listening a lot, really figuring things out before I decided that
",3
"we needed to make any changes. Ultimately, really coming to a really clear understanding of what it
",3
"was Marine Special Operations Command needed out of the training center and kind of built a plan
",0
"from there. You know, built the vision for what the training center needed to be and started putting
",4
"in motion a campaign plan to achieve that. And, you know, I knew it was working when, when my Marines
",4
"ultimately ended up using my words against me to do things that they wanted to do. You know, one of
",4
"the things that I, that I told them all was, you know, it's a, it's a mindset I call win every day.
",4
"If you're improving what you do, if you're improving yourself personally and professionally,
",3
"improving your fighting hole, that place that you work every single day, just a little bit,
",3
"then you're winning. You know, the, the, the theory of the aggregate of incremental gains tells
",4
"you that if you improve what you do by 1% a day at the end of the year, you're going to be 10 times
",3
"better than you are. So, you know, that doesn't sound as mountable. It's easy. We can get 1%
",4
"of that. Maybe not every day, but still over time that aggregates, you're going to get a lot better.
",3
"So, you know, that was one of the things that I pushed was constant improvement on what we do,
",4
"being very, you know, very reactive to the, the needs of our customers who are the Marine
",0
"Raider Regiment, the deploying units that we're going down, down, down range and making sure that
",2
"we were giving them everything that they need in terms of training in the way that they needed it.
",3
"And ultimately ended up having a, you know, a really successful tour there and learned a ton.
",4
"You know, it, for me personally, you know, the Marines that come through that process,
",4
"assessment and selection and the training and Marine Special Operations Command are just
",0
"amazing individuals, you know, the, the, the cream of the crop. And we, we assess about 230 Marines
",0
"every three, you know, three times a year going through assessment selection, ultimately ended
",4
"up, you know, selecting only 30 to 40. Yeah. And every one of those 230 Marines were awesome Marines.
",4
"So you can imagine the caliber of the individuals that were working with that organization
",3
"and just being exposed to that and seeing the things that they were capable of doing.
",3
"Yeah. Really gave me the opportunity to really push the edges in terms of what we're doing training
",3
"wise and really make some big gains and really do a lot of good for the organization because I had
",3
"that caliber of people. Were you overseeing selection and training? Yeah. So I had assessment
",3
"selection and then I had 14 different special operations courses that the training center
",3
"ran everything from the individual training course, which was the course that everybody
",3
"goes through once they're selected to qualify either as a critical skills operator or a special
",3
"operations officer. And then, you know, other special operations, advanced courses that run the
",4
"gamut from CQB courses to breaching courses and everything in between. So all the formal training
",3
"that happened at Marsock felt happened in the Marine Rider Training Center. And then, you know,
",0
"one of the things that I keyed on when I took command was when my division or when
",3
"the Marsock commander was talking, he talked about how the Marine Rider Training Center was kind of
",0
"the, you know, the cultural hub of Marine Special Operations Command because everybody goes through
",0
"that gate. Yeah. You know, so that we spent a lot of time really working on the culture,
",4
"establishing, you know, what it was we wanted our Marines to be and do, what we wanted our
",4
"organization to be and do. And that ultimately ended up bubbling up into the entire command. So
",3
"that was a really meaningful experience as well as getting the opportunity to influence the culture
",3
"itself. You know, we spent a lot of time really trying to define what that meant through surveys
",4
"and other things like that, understanding what the Marines thought the culture was and then
",3
"building on that from there. So that was a great, a great tour. Did two years of command there,
",3
"was selected by the commanding general to be his chief of staff on the commitment that I'd
",3
"stand that job for two years as the chief. It was a great job. I mean, it was one of those jobs
",3
"where your job is related to ensure that what the commanding general wants to get done gets done.
",3
"Enabling his staff and his subordinate commanders to achieve his intent.
",2
"You know, so I was at the top, I wouldn't say I ran, but I was a senior staff officer on about a
",4
"responsible for synchronizing and integrating all the organization, all the activities of the staff
",3
"and the subordinate commands to a lesser extent to achieve the commanding general's vision.
",3
"And I was about a year into that. And I got a call from a buddy that told me this organization,
",3
"Boseman, Montana, Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation was looking for a new executive
",3
"director. This was an organization that I learned about when I was on the joint staff working
",3
"veterans issues. And I'd known a board member from Warriors and Quiet Waters from a previous
",4
"introduction. So I called him and I said, Hey, I hear Warriors and Quiet Waters is looking for a
",3
"new ED. Do you think I'd be a good fit? He thought about it for about two seconds. He told me,
",3
"I think it'd be a great fit. Well, it's cool. Yeah, that experience. Yeah. Yeah. You should
",1
"throw your name in the hat. So I did that. Didn't tell my boss because I wasn't sure how I was going
",3
"to work out. And I've gone through the interview process and ultimately was offered the job.
",3
"And, you know, had about a five minute conversation with my wife. We were planning again on Marine
",0
"Corps yet. I still have another year as it is the chief of staff at Marsox. And I was going to take
",3
"another another another move and do three more years to get me to 30 years. That was the plan.
",3
"But I had about a five minute conversation with my wife, Marianne. Yeah, this is the right thing.
",3
"We got to go for it. That I was worried about telling my boss, the major general that I worked
",3
"for, because, you know, I committed to him for two years. He was counting on that. He was he
",4
"was going to be leaving at the end of that year. And he wanted the chief to be there for continuity
",3
"as a new commander came in. And I was really concerned about, I'll be honest. So I approached
",2
"him, you know, from the perspective that, you know, I got a problem. I'd like to talk to you about it.
",4
"And I remember when he when I first told him that I've been offered this job, he looked at me and
",3
"said, you know, after Brian, this place will fall apart without you. I'm like, damn, this is not going
",4
"to go good. But over the course of about about a 30 minute conversation, you know, he came around to
",4
"realize that it was the right thing and told me, yeah, I think you should do it. All in the same
",3
"conversation. Crazy. Well, I mean, just to show you, Calvary leader, he was yeah, major general, you
",3
"yeah. So I did it. I submitted my resignation papers and I got out of the Marine Corps in about
",0
"four months and moved here in June of 2020. Took over on July 6th, that is the executive director
",3
"of the Quiet Waters Foundation. And like I said, it was perfect. I learned when I was on the joint
",3
"staff that I was going to work in the nonprofit space when I got out of the Marine Corps. Yeah.
",0
"Coming home to Montana was always what was going to happen no matter what. So, you know, this was
",4
"the perfect circumstances coming together for my family and I, you know, so it was easy, easy,
",4
"easy answer. Do it. And that's what I've been doing ever since. That's amazing. Yeah. Yeah. And
",1
"a lot of purpose there. I mean, keeping guys on mission, getting them back on mission. Yeah. So,
",3
"you know, that's something else I learned on the work with veterans on the joint staff.
",4
"You know, that's the huge role that purpose serves in the lives of service members and veterans.
",4
"And the way I like to tell people about it is this, if you think about it, when people come into
",3
"the military, we all have a hierarchy of needs. You know, there are all things that we need to
",4
"thrive from the most basic needs like food and water, we got to have a job. You know, we need
",4
"connection because we're human beings that, you know, evolved into being social animals.
",4
"And ultimately, we, you know, we have to have, you know, some sense of pride in who we are and we
",4
"the military strips all that stuff that you had away. They break you down as an individual.
",3
"They build you back up as a member of the team. And then they issue you that, issue you that
",3
"hierarchy needs. They take care of it all for you. Yeah. They take care of your house and your food.
",3
"They take care of all your training and professional development. They give you very, very clear
",3
"purpose and admission. And you have that for the entire time that you're in the military. Yeah.
",3
"And that's what your experience is, a very strong sense of purpose about what you do.
",3
"But when you leave the military, that's all stripped away. And you're essentially left to
",3
"rebuild the hierarchy of needs from the gig. You know, a lot of veterans, the first thing that
",4
"they're concerned about is getting a job, you know, because they got to take care of themselves and
",4
"their family. And that job doesn't necessarily always provide that purpose that they found
",3
"is being a member of the military. And this, this, this can create huge issues for veterans.
",3
"Big fears. Big fears. You know, what am I going to do to replace that sense of purpose that I had?
",4
"So I learned that. And I've been able to, to, to receive that, you know, in huge quantities,
",4
"being, you know, the executive director of an organization that helps post-9th element combat
",4
"veterans thrive. It gives me a sense of purpose every single day. Something that I can get out of
",3
"bed and be excited about every single day. You know, it's more than just the bottom line of some
",4
"company. It's having a meaningful impact on hundreds and thousands of other individuals.
",3
"Not hard to get behind that. Yeah. Change in lives, save in lives. Yeah. So, you know, I'm blessed
",4
"because of that. Did you have some of the transitional struggles your own or did years go
",3
"just really smooth because of you just went from purpose to purpose? Yeah. I mean, I, I,
",3
"I tell everybody it went smooth. And, you know, I had, I had peers, other colonels, Navy captains
",4
"that told me I was getting out that, Hey dude, your first year is going to suck. Just be ready for
",3
"that. But I didn't experience that at all. And I think that's because I had that purpose again.
",3
"You know, I was falling into a job where, where in a lifestyle where that was exactly what I wanted.
",4
"Plus, you know, a job and then plus the lifestyle that I'd longed for ever since I've been in the
",4
"Marine Corps here that you can find here in Montana, which was always a huge part of my life. Yeah.
",0
"You know, and, you know, I had known some people in the community, other, other service members
",4
"that I served with in the community. So I had those ties. And then, you know, the, the opportunity
",4
"interact with veterans on a day to day basis. It was all built right in. So I didn't experience that
",3
"myself. I'd say my transition is going pretty smooth. Now, yeah, there's things that I miss.
",3
"I mean, I, I miss the Marines. I miss the training. I miss those kinds of opportunities. But, you know,
",3
"the thing is, is that you can't do those things forever. You know, being a Marine was getting
",0
"harder physically every day. As you can imagine, after 27 years, a bunch of combat deployments,
",3
"the body started to break down and things like that. So you, I mean, you got to recognize that
",3
"you're not going to be doing that, you know, that stuff that was ultimately the stuff that kept you
",4
"in initially forever. Seasons. Yeah. So what are you telling folks now that are getting out that
",3
"aren't exactly blessed to find that purpose at their job? How are they finding that outside of
",3
"their job? Yeah. So I think that, you know, that that's not something that everybody's going to be
",4
"able to find in a job. Yeah. At the end of the day, you have to have an occupation so you can take
",3
"care of your family, be financially stable, have a future. And you may not, you may not be as lucky
",3
"as I am where you found that opportunity to get that sense of purpose from there. But you don't
",3
"have to get your sense of purpose, in my opinion, from, from your occupation. There are lots of
",3
"other ways where you can find that. And I think that the hardest part for veterans to grapple with
",3
"is figuring out what that is. You know, what is going to bring your life meaning? You know,
",4
"what is your potential now that you're a veteran? Who are you? You know, I was, when I was a Marine,
",0
"active duty Marine, that was a huge part of my identity. Marine. Every single day,
",0
"you know, putting that uniform on, wearing an eagle globe and anchor over my heart. Yeah. That was a
",4
"huge part of who I was. How are you going to replace that identity? And I think it's really,
",3
"you know, going through the self reflection and the hard thinking to really understand where you
",4
"think you're going to find that new identity and that new purpose, if you can't find it in your job.
",3
"You know, how are you going to do that as a veteran? If you have to do something that doesn't,
",4
"you know, for, for, for a paycheck that doesn't give you the opportunity to do that. Yeah. You know,
",4
"my purpose is service and leadership. You know, I'm blessed with the opportunity where I can do
",4
"that in my job. But if I didn't have this job, there'd be other ways to do that. You know, there
",4
"are a lot of, a lot of great organizations out there that allow me to serve and lead. You know,
",4
"worries and quiet waters is what I'm, I'm employed there, but there are others, you know, I'll name
",4
"one, the Travis Manning Foundation. You know, they have a program called the character does matter
",4
"that allows retired and former service members to find that purpose through teaching character
",3
"and leadership to, to, to youth. You know, so that's one way you can do it. There's, you know,
",4
"it's really a matter of figuring out what that, what that purpose is. And then you can build it
",3
"from there. Yeah. And you can build it from there. And what is, I love the concept of your hunt for
",3
"purpose initiative because in my mind with Mountain Tough, we're always working with guys,
",3
"especially to find their why. And we know that, we know that sometimes you just need to artificially
",4
"create that why until a bigger why takes its spot. So a lot of guys know that finding their why is
",4
"going to get them on track, get them focused. But sometimes you have to artificially create one
",3
"to get the wheels in motion. And so I think your hunt for purpose initiative does a pretty
",3
"beautiful job of that with physical fitness, mental fitness, nutrition, shooting your bow.
",3
"So how did you set that up? I mean, that came from my experiences as a hunter.
",3
"I started hunting like most kids in Montana do because my parent, my dad did. You know,
",4
"and it was a fun time for me to go and hang out with my cousins and my uncles and my dad and,
",3
"you know, have fun hunting. But ultimately, it became a lot more for that, more than that for me.
",4
"My dad was probably the world's biggest introvert and stoic. Didn't talk a lot. Really hard to get
",3
"to know, even as a son. But he was a different person hunting. I mean, he'd tell stories, he'd
",4
"laugh, he was just very open. So I, you know, that's one of the reasons that hunting became so
",4
"important to me early on was because it gave me an opportunity to really connect with my dad
",3
"with my dad in a way that I couldn't before. And then I joined the Marine Corps and, you know,
",0
"my opportunities to hunt became less and less. So I'd come home for a year. My dad was an archery
",3
"guy, so it was always raffle hunting. But, you know, that was that one thing I was looking forward
",4
"to every year is, you know, the fall, getting here and getting home for a week hunt. And then,
",4
"I didn't, you know, I went to combat, saw the things that I did. And, you know, I was pretty
",4
"blessed with regards to my combat deployments. Wasn't wounded, you know, lost one Marine,
",0
"saw some others, some others wounded, but didn't have some of the experiences that so many others
",3
"do or, you know, a ton of trauma. But I carried some burdens from that. And, you know, my first
",4
"trip back home after combat was on a hunt. I wasn't with my dad that day on the mountain because
",3
"he was older. He typically stayed in the truck at that point. He dropped me off, picked me up.
",3
"Ended up killing an elk in a snowstorm in the Greenhorn Mountains in a place that I call Salis
",3
"Park. And I remember standing over that elk after that deployment and thinking, you know,
",4
"I'm honest, this may sound cheesy, but I've never felt closer to God than I did in that moment.
",3
"And I really understood really what hunting did for me and really being able to find clarity,
",3
"find some peace and make meaning of those things that I experienced in combat.
",3
"And I continued to go to that for the rest of my career, come home. My dad died in 2015, so I picked
",3
"up a bow again and really focused on archery hunting from that on. And, you know, archery hunting
",4
"is giving me year-round purpose. You know, in the Marine Corps, there are a lot of different
",0
"reasons why I stayed in shape, you know, to be an active duty Marine. That's the requirement.
",0
"But since then, you know, my love for archery hunting is what gives me year-round drive to
",4
"stand shape. Gives me year-round drive to make sure that when I'm not hunting, I'm at home and
",3
"I'm present and I'm taking care of those things that my family needs, that, you know, they're
",4
"getting from me what they need so that I have the time in the fall to go hunting. You know,
",4
"I do things like go to the symphony with my wife and the opera and play because it's important
",3
"and I want to earn that opportunity when September rolls around to step aside and say, honey,
",3
"I'm going to the mountains and her being okay with that. You know, so it ensures that I'm just
",4
"getting better in every domain of my life because I'm an archery elk hunter. And it was that experience
",3
"that gave me the idea for hunting for purpose. Warriors in Quiet Waters exist to help post-9
",3
"11 combat veterans thrive. And I think in order for veterans to thrive, they have to be living a
",3
"meaningful life, a life of purpose. And I realized because in my experience as a hunter, what I gained
",3
"from that coming home from combat, that that was something that we could use to help post-9
",3
"11 combat veterans find more clarity on the answers to those big questions. Who am I? What can I do?
",3
"What do I value? And what's going to bring my life purpose? And using that using archery elk hunting
",3
"as a mechanism to do that because like you said, we've integrated holistic wellness into it. You
",3
"we've brought in an integrated nutrition coach that talks to them about their nutrition because
",3
"of the gut brain connection and the profound impact that the food that you eat has on your
",3
"physical health and your mental health. It's huge. We've brought in through Mountain Tough and
",3
"in your all's partnership with us to focus on always being ready physically for what's going
",3
"to come your way in the mountains. And then we've brought in other partners like the Commit Foundation
",3
"that has helped have helped us bring them through this guided discovery process where
",3
"they're they're spending a lot of time really thinking about these big questions on identity
",3
"values, potential and purpose. Is a deliberate part of the program where we're guiding them
",3
"through exercises to think about this stuff. And then we're using archery elk hunting to
",3
"reinforce that. You know, so spend some time reflecting on, you know, what's my life going to be
",4
"going forward and then going through on a ruck on your back and going doing an archery course.
",3
"And the science shows that, you know, when you're doing things like that, recreation in nature,
",4
"whether it be archery elk hunting, whether it be fly fishing, which is the core activity that we do
",3
"at Ores and Quiet Waters, in nature, it does some specific things for the human. The first thing
",3
"it does is it distracts you from your day to day challenges because it's an activity that's keeping
",3
"you fully immersed. As you know, you got to be present as an archery elk hunter. You got to be
",4
"present when you're behind that bow. You got to be present when you're closing in, all that.
",3
"And then it provides you comfort because it's an enjoyable activity. And those two things together,
",3
"the research shows gives you a dopamine dump. And then the combination of that distraction,
",3
"that comfort and that dopamine makes humans better problem solvers. It makes them more creative.
",3
"It gives them a better outlook on life. It makes them more vital. They're more engaged in the world
",3
"that they live in. And really, that's, you know, those are the ingredients that they're thriving,
",4
"they're looking for. So, you know, create the, I call them these learning moments,
",4
"create these learning moments where we can create the conditions for our participants to have epiphanies
",3
"about what their, what their, what a life of meaning and purpose looks like going forward,
",3
"by capitalizing on those physical and physiological and psychological things that happen to the human
",3
"when you're spending time in nature and immersive activity like archery elk hunting. So that's the
",3
"whole idea. So hunt for purpose is a six month program where we're bringing our participants
",3
"back here three separate times, started back in March where we had the initial week where it was
",3
"really about getting them all their equipment, getting them fitted on their bows, getting them
",3
"trained on how to use them, spending some time with their rucks on their back, teaching them
",3
"archery elk hunting skills while we're going through this guided discovery process around
",3
"those pillars of the thriving, thriving, thriving life, identity, potential purpose and values.
",3
"So we spent the first week kind of is a ramp up week doing that. It's when we first engage with
",3
"you all in the workouts, really got them moving on that. And then they went home. And in the time
",3
"that they've been home, they continue to meet on a weekly basis with their volunteer companions.
",3
"So these are the battle buddies that are going through this with them. They can continue to
",3
"engage in Mountain Tuff's app to make sure they're staying up on their workouts, they continue to
",3
"engage with our integrated nutrition coach, Karen Mitchell. And we've given them some other online
",3
"tools like the elk 101 elk university where they can continue to hone their archery elk hunting
",3
"skills. They'll come back here the first week of June for what we're calling hunt for purpose boot
",3
"camp, which will be a week long, really intense experience where we're really going to dial them
",3
"up on their archery elk hunting skills. We're going to finish that guided discovery process
",3
"around those pillars of the thriving life. And then they're going to go home after that first week
",3
"or after that second week, and then they'll continue that remote work while they're home with
",3
"their companions. And they'll come back in September and they'll do a week long archery elk hunt.
",3
"So it's amazing. Yeah. So we're splitting the hunters into two different cohorts in September.
",3
"So there'll be two different hunt weeks, really two unique experiences, one on a private ranch
",3
"with a landowner who's always supported boards of quiet waters and the second cohort will be
",3
"in the bottom of Marshallville in a sudden. That's amazing. And it's a serious deal, right?
",3
"Like if they're skipping workouts and not taking this thing serious, they can just get kicked off
",3
"the group. We can't make them do anything. We've asked them to make commitments so right up front.
",3
"You know, that was the first thing that we talked about when the first week of hunt for purpose
",4
"kicked off was that this wasn't going to be easy. And we're asking you all to commit.
",3
"And then doing it at a cohort, then you have that camaraderie. And you also have that pure
",3
"accountability. And that's the idea of keeping them connected while they're home. We keep them
",3
"connected around Google Classroom, different social media, and Zoom calls. So that pure
",3
"accountability sticks. And we've seen it really, we haven't had to ask them to. I mean, they've
",3
"been committed. They've been doing the work, all the physical training work through your app.
",3
"They've been connecting with Karen, our nutrition coach. They've been connecting with their
",3
"companions and talking about the challenges that they're having going through the program
",3
"and really staying engaged. You know, some are dealing with injuries, things like that. So we've
",4
"asked them to back off a little bit so they're ready for the boot camp when they get, when
",3
"June rolls around. But it hasn't been a matter of making them do it. They've went full into it.
",3
"And I really think it's that camaraderie, that pure accountability and the opportunity that we're
",3
"offering them to really figure out what a life of purpose looks like going forward.
",3
"Are you seeing some life change already?
",3
"Yeah. I mean, based on some of the discussions that we had after the first week,
",3
"some conversations with a couple of the local participants that I've had here,
",3
"it, you know, with a couple of them, it's the right thing at the right time for them, you know,
",4
"where they're really, they're going through a life transition where, you know, they're really
",4
"struggling about, you know, what is my future look like. And I think it's really, it's really
",4
"helped them a lot, become a lot more clear on that. I think it's also reminded them of who they were.
",3
"You know, I, veterans in the post 9-11 year have all experienced trauma.
",4
"They all come with their own unique set of challenges based on their own individual
",3
"experiences that they had. And the problem with a lot of the discussions around veterans,
",3
"in my opinion, in America is that it falls at one or two extremes, either everybody's a hero,
",3
"or everybody's broken in a victim. You know, that's where typically most, most folks that don't
",4
"have a, an affinity to the military through a close connection, they're going to fall in one of
",3
"those two areas. And the fact is that the vast majority of veterans aren't either of those.
",3
"You know, they're ordinary people who've done and seen extraordinary things.
",4
"And as a result of that, they've collected some residue, they've collected some challenges that
",3
"they, you know, they got to struggle with like we all do. But they're not broken, they're not
",4
"victims. And what we try to do is to remind every one of them, you know, think about that person
",4
"you were on your best day in the military, you know, when you were, you were at the top of your
",4
"game, that person's still there. It's just a matter of finding them. It's a matter of scraping
",3
"that residue, finding that person again, and then figuring out which direction they need to point
",3
"and let them go. You know, that's where that sense of purpose comes. I fundamentally believe
",4
"that's what post-Nile Island veterans are. And, you know, I think if, if we're able to help veterans
",4
"thrive, then we're going to be better off as a country. Thriving veterans contribute to thriving
",3
"communities. And that means a better future for every one of us. Better America, yeah.
",3
"And with suicide at like an all-time high, depression at an all-time high, anxiety at an
",3
"all-time high, at Mount Tuff, we were spending a lot of time this year just challenging guys
",3
"to just get outside and do something hard. And we're, we're not even particular about what that
",3
"is. We just want them to put it on your calendar, do something really hard for you. And we need it
",3
"to be outside because we know that it'll create that, that, that dopamine rush and, and lead to
",4
"a life-changing moment. And just putting it on the calendar creates this
",3
"like Spartan effect where because it's on the calendar, now they're training for it. And then
",3
"the training sometimes is more transformational than the event itself. And that's kind of our
",3
"big challenge for guys this year is do something really hard outside. Yeah. You know, that's,
",4
"that's where some places I arrived at over time. Like I said, you know, you stay
",4
"in shape and do hard things in the military a lot because it's what you have to do. And I
",3
"recognize that that was a piece of me that needed to continue once I, once I left. I mean, it could
",3
"have been easy not to do that kind of stuff. That would have been the easy answer. But I recognize
",3
"that, you know, that, that drive, that, you know, doing hard things gave me was a big part of who
",4
"I was. I mean, let's be honest, it was part of my identity. So, you know, doing hard things is a
",4
"big part of my life. It's something I beat into my kids. I got two teenage boys, they're tired
",3
"of hearing from their dad and do hard things. You need more grit. But, you know, I fundamentally
",4
"believe that's an essential aspect of people's lives and we'll be able to thrive. You know, I think,
",4
"I think as human beings, you know, that's built into us. And it's a matter of really,
",4
"you know, figuring out where those frontiers are and pushing to them and hopefully beyond them.
",4
"And I'm, so I'm not surprised that they, you know, that they find the training itself more
",4
"meaningful than the actual experience because, you know, that's really where you're able to push
",4
"yourselves to those limits with no real risk. But you're really going to learn a ton about yourself.
",3
"Yeah. And who you are. Yeah, it's amazing. Yeah. Yeah, my wife and I, we used to be very into
",1
"marathons and ultra marathons and looking back at those years that we did a lot of that,
",3
"in hindsight now, it was the training for those big events that was so special because it's like
",3
"the event is just one day, but it takes an entire summer of training to get ready for that event,
",3
"which changes the whole trajectory of your life because now you're on goal, on target,
",3
"all summer for something really big. Yeah. It builds discipline into your life. It really does.
",3
"You know, through and it creates habits, which are really the, you know, I look back at my success
",4
"and, you know, number one, it's the people that I worked with without a doubt. You know, a lot of
",4
"people help me out a lot of different ways, people that I worked for, people that worked with me,
",3
"people that worked for me, you know, that that's the number one key, but the second was being able
",4
"to build routines and habits that, you know, gave me a work ethic that made me do the hard things
",4
"and do the hard work necessary to be successful. It's those routines and habits that have really
",3
"established how I run my life now. You know, every day is the same. I eat pretty much the same food
",4
"every day. I feel the same every day because of that. And I go home at the end of the day satisfied
",3
"because of what I was able to get done. You know, it starts out with early morning workouts.
",4
"If nothing else goes right that day, at least I got that done. So it's all part of those routines
",3
"and habits that are critical for me personally. And that's something that we're trying to bring
",3
"into the hunt for purposes, you know, helping the participants recognize the opportunity that
",4
"comes with building those routines and habits because motivation is fleeting. If you try to
",3
"do something because you're motivated to do it, you're ultimately going to fail because that
",3
"motivation is not going to stick around forever. It's really a matter of building the habits and
",3
"routines that ultimately become a discipline and ultimately identity who you are. You know,
",4
"I get up early and work out every morning ultimately because I'm an archery Elkunter.
",3
"And I want to be able to perform in the mountains. And you know what? I also want to be ready for
",4
"whatever life throws my way because you don't know. You don't know. You don't know. You know,
",4
"I'm really good about how I eat for the same reasons. And plus it makes me feel better.
",3
"You know, I'm 52, 27 years in the Marine Corps, I'm just pouring my body a little bit. But,
",0
"you know, I found that through making sure that I'm staying away from grains and sugars,
",4
"I don't have information in my joints. I'm not dealing with that pain.
",3
"And that's been some trial and error that ultimately I arrived at. And
",3
"because I've established those routines and pretty much eating the same thing day after
",3
"day, it's become a habit and that's my discipline now. And I feel better as a result of it.
",3
"Yeah. What time are you working out?
",1
"Usually six o'clock. At the home gym.
",3
"At the home gym. I bought a bunch of equipment back in 2013 and been working on it off in a gym
",3
"at home ever since. And I do it in the mornings because I can never predict how my day is going
",3
"to go. If I get it done in the morning, at least I got that done. Nothing comes up in the morning.
",3
"No barbecues, no conference calls. And that's where I've established that routine. I get up
",3
"pretty early. I get up before every day. I spend the first hour reading. So that's another discipline
",3
"that I follow. I said service and leadership is my purpose. I consider myself a student of
",3
"leadership forever. And reading is a big part of that practice. So I try to read every day.
",3
"And I'm not one of those guys that can roll right out of the rack and throw on my shoes and go
",3
"work out. I got to wake up. I got to get a cup of coffee in me. So that gives me about an hour to
",3
"get ready. About 5.30, 6 o'clock, I'm heading to the gym. Awesome. I wanted to back up on three things.
",3
"One is where were you at on 9-11? Where were you? What happened that day for you?
",3
"I was living in Oceanside, California. I was assigned a first reconnaissance battalion,
",2
"on the battalion staff at the time. And I heard about it as I was driving down College Boulevard
",2
"in Oceanside, California to work. I heard about it on the radio. It happened 9 o'clock East Coast
",3
"time. So this was 7 o'clock West Coast time. I heard about it. Called my wife, told her what
",3
"was happening, went into work. And the whole battalion was in a big spin. We're ordering maps
",3
"for Afghanistan. Convinced we're going to deploy right away. Things are getting locked down because
",2
"there was a lot of misinformation at the time. A lot of false reports about other attacks coming in.
",3
"Really, that's what we did. We spent that day watching on the TV ordering maps for Afghanistan
",3
"and starting the wheels turning to get ready to deploy because we were certain that it was coming
",2
"immediately. Ultimately, we didn't deploy for two more years. But that's where I was.
",2
"And where did you meet your wife at? I met her when I was an instructor out of Virginia Beach.
",3
"She had grown up in Ohio. She was living in Washington, DC, working for McKinsey and Company.
",3
"And she had an aunt and uncle that lived down Virginia Beach, Virginia. It just so happened
",3
"she went to college with the other captain that I mentioned that I was an instructor with.
",3
"We were going out and he knew she was in town. So he called her and asked her if she wanted to meet
",4
"us. So I met my wife at Crocs Bar in Virginia Beach, Virginia. That's awesome. Six months later,
",3
"we were married. Six months. Six months later. That's awesome. That was 22 years ago. Crazy.
",3
"22 years ago. Congratulations. That's great. And then I wanted to fast forward a little bit to a
",3
"Marine Raider selection. And you talked about 230 guys three times a year,
",0
"30 of them making it through. What did you start to see and boil down to as far as the mental
",3
"toughness and grit, skills and lifestyle habits and mindfulness? What got some of those guys through?
",3
"What made some of those guys fail? What did you see there as general trends?
",3
"Yeah. So Marsock stole a lot from the other services in terms of their assessment selection.
",3
"Their last military service to stand up for a special operations command. So we stole a lot
",3
"from the Army, stole a lot from the Navy in terms of how we put assessment selection together. And
",3
"ultimately it boiled down to 10 attributes. And off the top of my head, I can't remember them all,
",3
"but leadership, integrity, mental toughness were three of those 10 attributes. And over the course
",3
"of a pretty long selection process, we collect about 5,000 points of data on every individual.
",3
"We had a software program that would take all that data in, and then it would display it in a way
",3
"that we could start assessing people's levels of these different attributes. So ultimately,
",3
"that's what we were selecting for those attributes. So the Marines that didn't make it through were
",3
"still great Marines. I told everybody, we weren't looking for the perfect Marine, we were looking
",0
"for a 10-pointed star. Those 10 attributes. Very specific. And a lot of really great Marines that
",3
"were physical studs didn't make it through for whatever reason. But there were givens that you
",3
"had to come to the table with. You had to be physically resilient because it's a long process.
",3
"You got to have endurance. You have to be physically capable. You had to be in shape because we're
",3
"asking you to move on long distances with a lot of weight on you. And you had to be mentally tough
",3
"because that's the key is that moving over that long distance with a lot of weight on you wasn't
",3
"the test. It was what you did in that process. We'd force you into making decisions. We'd force
",3
"you into leadership positions where you're on your physical edge and you still have to be able to
",3
"respond to a certain scenario in a certain way. And that's where that really came in was it was
",3
"more than just being able to do hard things. It was being able to function effectively on a cognitive
",3
"basis on a social basis because we throw them into social scenarios as well because that's
",3
"putting a big part in what special operations operators do. While you're under that physical
",3
"duress, while you're at that physical frontier, being able to perform in those other those other
",3
"domains was really what it boiled down to. So mental toughness played a huge role in that.
",3
"And it wasn't something that you were given the opportunity to build while your assessment
",3
"selection. It's something that you had to you had to foster as you came into it because the process
",3
"would weed you out really quick if you didn't have it really quick. So it's like
",3
"you know, being strong under high heart rate. Yeah, same thing. Yeah. Being cognitively and
",4
"socially highly functional while under extreme physical duress. Yeah. A lot of it boiled down
",3
"to. Yeah. Crazy. Yeah. And how long was selection? The Marine Corps is six weeks long. Okay. Yeah.
",1
"Six weeks long. Two different phases. First phase is all known problems for the candidates where
",3
"they're told the event that they're going to do. They told they're told what the standard is
",3
"and then they're asked to perform. So they know the answer. They know what they got to do.
",4
"You know, you have to you have to throw 90 pounds on your back and you have to
",4
"rock over this distance in this time. So it was known what you had to do to perform.
",4
"The second phase was exactly the opposite. We moved into a different location and everything was
",3
"an unknown event. You'd be told to start something and you didn't know how it was going to end up.
",4
"And that's how pretty much that the second half was conducted. And you're doing all that in a team
",3
"environment. You were assigned a leadership role or not. And when you were assigned a leadership
",3
"role, you were being evaluated on your ability to lead your team through that problem set.
",3
"All with an unknown answer. You don't know what the answer is. You're given a problem. You're
",4
"told what needs to get done and or get it solved. And then how you do it's up to you.
",3
"And like I said, a lot of uncertainty thrown into there. And that's once again,
",3
"where that mental toughness comes in as well, is being able to operate effectively in uncertainty.
",3
"So that probably broke a lot of guys down the no end game. You just don't know when it's over.
",4
"Yeah, absolutely. And is there a hell week type event?
",3
"There's not really in the Marine's assessment selection process.
",0
"Mars selection assessment process. It's just a long build up of all these events
",3
"cumulatively that it comes to. There's something very similar to that in an individual training
",3
"course. Okay. Once a Marine's been selected, they got to get through the individual training
",0
"courses broken down into four phases. And they have to get through what looks a lot like a hell
",3
"week at the end of the first phase. You know, it's constantly moving with about 90 pounds on your
",4
"back getting very, very little sleep, being thrown a couple new problem sets every day in a team
",3
"environment. So not the same as hell week, but I think it achieves similar results. So that's
",3
"and that's a lot of a lot of heavy pack rocking work was happening there though, which
",3
"yeah, it was a constant constant condition of it. Yeah, everything that they did, it was,
",1
"you know, moving over long distances with a lot of weight on your back heavy loads.
",4
"What kind of distances would you see?
",3
"Well, in that week that I talked about in the first phase, I want to try to remember,
",3
"I want to say they were moving over seven days close to 90 miles,
",3
"90 miles is about 90 pound packs. Crazy. So yeah, in assessment selection, the longest known distance
",3
"hike was 12 miles, 12 miles, and once again done to a time standard. So the Marines are walking.
",3
"I mean, in order to meet the standard, you're in a minimum shuffle. You're jogging. Yeah,
",3
"which ultimately, you know, breaks and havoc on some joints, but they're young. Yeah. You know,
",4
"as the commander, I go out and do those rocks with them. You know, always knowing that, you know,
",4
"I'm going up against 20 year olds, there's no way I'm going to be at the front, but I was in the
",3
"front third, in the front third, because that's what I felt I needed to do as a leader, show up
",3
"and do that. I didn't make everyone, I didn't make every hike, but I tried to make as many as I could.
",3
"Yeah. So that was a huge component of it. Was there a little, like a mental toughness
",3
"hack or mindset hack or mind trick that you saw was helping a lot of those guys pass that?
",3
"Yeah. So that's the other thing that I really got exposed to when I was at Marine Special Operations
",0
"Command was the psychological aspects of performance. Yeah. And Special Operations Command has figured
",3
"this out. You know, I had a couple operational psychologists on my staff that when we had Marines
",0
"that were struggling, whether this was in the shoot house, whether it was in some other aspect
",3
"of the course where we could bring them together with this operational psychologist,
",3
"and they put them through some cognitive work. You know, whether that was a mental toughness
",4
"issue, whether that was being able to recognize the essence of the problem that they were facing,
",3
"that our psychs helped us in every aspect of that. You know, whenever a student was struggling,
",4
"they'd go and they'd see the op psych. You know, this was nothing that had any kind of,
",4
"you know, baggage associated with it was all part of the process. Performance. In most cases,
",4
"you know, these are professionals that, you know, they've spent their lives figuring out how to
",4
"optimize human performance in that cognitive domain. So they, you know, that was a huge part of it.
",4
"That's awesome. Yeah. Yeah. We see it a lot in here, just like the most mentally tough people.
",1
"We've been studying them for, you know, since 2016 now with our small lens that we get to see
",4
"through the lab. But just watching that on the daily basis, you start to see things that
",3
"most mentally tough people have. Like we call it, we always call it like they're positive when
",3
"everyone else is negative. You'll see that with the hunters. They'll be the guy that
",3
"when it's negative 20 and the snow is blowing in your face, he'll look at you and say,
",3
"at least it's not negative 30. But as soon as you make that mental switch, you're like,
",3
"yeah, I feel pretty good. Now, at least it's not negative 30. And so we start to kind of see those
",3
"key characteristics. We call that embrace the suck. Yeah. That's a huge part of it. I think
",3
"positivity is a huge part of it as well. Recognizing that things can always get worse.
",3
"And I go back to
",3
"something I learned about, God, the name's escaping me now.
",3
"Navy Admiral was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And what he learned was the thing that set
",3
"those people that survived that experience apart from those that didn't were the optimists,
",3
"ultimately didn't survive because they would hope we're going to be home by Christmas.
",3
"And when that didn't happen, they'd lose all hope. And ultimately ended up dying. What he learned
",3
"was it was the pragmatists who were able to stay positive throughout it. They were able to accept
",3
"life circumstances as they are, but still maintain a positive attitude in terms of how it can get
",3
"better. Not putting all your buckets in this bag of hope that could get crushed,
",3
"being very pragmatic about the situation that you're in, but addressing it in a positive manner.
",3
"I think that's key. Yeah, that's in man's search for meaning. The people that set Christmas as that
",3
"goal were literally dying a few days after Christmas from their mind. We read the same book.
",3
"Wild. Yeah. Crazy. Stockdale. Yeah, Stockdale. Yeah, that's an amazing book.
",1
"Yeah, it is. So what are you doing nowadays with your boys to teach some of this grit and
",3
"determination? Yeah, so I learned early on, my kids were, you got to do everything in small doses.
",3
"First time I brought my older son, Hunt, and it was a backcountry hunt. We
",3
"humped in the back country. Weather wasn't playing a great role. The wind was blowing like crazy
",3
"the whole time and really was wearing into him. I remember on, it was the end of day two, we'd
",3
"spent the whole day at high altitude hiking our butts off in this high winds. Finally get back to
",3
"camp and I look at him and you just tell he's defeated. He's just done. So I recognized, there's
",3
"a storm coming in. You know what? We're going to pull out. We're going to go back to view. We're
",4
"going to shower up and then we'll come back tomorrow afternoon. As soon as I told him that,
",3
"his whole attitude changed. Life was positive. So everything in small doses, that's number one.
",3
"But I do ask him to do things that push their boundaries. And this is something I tried to
",3
"work on when they were really young. My son Tyler, my older son, I remember when we were in
",3
"Carlisle, Pennsylvania, when I was going to the Armoury World College. He's always been a smart
",3
"kid. Did real well in school. And I used to help him study math. We had a room above the garage
",3
"where we'd go up and pull out the whiteboard and put up problems for him. And he'd go through
",3
"them. I remember prepping for a test for one of them with him. And then he came home and I asked
",3
"him what I did on the test and he didn't do that great because he hadn't spent that time preparing.
",3
"And I told him one time, I said, Tyler, you're really talented kid, but you're talented. So far
",3
"you got to work hard too. And he took that and that's how he's lived his life ever since.
",3
"He's a national merit scholar and he honored me with the essay that he had to write for that
",3
"scholarship. And he wrote about those things that I taught him. And that was one of those things.
",3
"Doing hard things, the role the grid has in your life. And I've probably taken it to extremes.
",3
"We wrote this Gilman family maxim that it's about 15 lines of things that the males and
",3
"the Gilman family will do. I had them both sign it and commit to that. I go to it all the time.
",3
"When they're falling short of that standard, we'll go back and we'll pull out that Gilman
",3
"code of conduct and talk about what that means. I haven't had to do it recently in quite a while.
",3
"What's a few of the things on there?
",3
"A lot. I can't remember the verbiage. I'll send you a picture.
",3
"You should, yeah.
",1
"It talks a lot about discipline. It talks about how you treat other people.
",3
"It talks about being confident in yourself, understanding who you are, being proud of that,
",3
"a bunch of stuff like that, doing hard things. That's great.
",3
"So hunting trips are things that we do. I brought my family on a pretty good hike last summer.
",3
"We hiked up to Sunrise Lake in the tobacco roots, which is about 11,000 feet, about a
",3
"seven mile approach march. And it was a slog. It was a hot July day, but we kept on it and we made it happen.
",3
"And they've always seen me working out in the gym at home, and they've taken on that ethic.
",3
"Both my sons have. They both work out regularly. My older son's a pretty accomplished track athlete
",3
"now, and he attributes all of his success to the discipline and that work ethic that he learned as
",3
"a kid by doing hard things. So we did similar hikes in Okinawa, hiking upstream beds to waterfalls,
",3
"just doing hard things. It doesn't have to be huge doses of it, but push yourself a little
",3
"bit, get a little bit uncomfortable, and then embrace that. Embrace the fact that it's 95 and 100%
",3
"humidity and you're really tired. But hey, look at that awesome waterfall right there. That's pretty cool.
",3
"That's amazing. Stuff like that. Stuff like that. It's so great. And you mentioned on that Elkhont,
",3
"that last one with your dad, never feeling closer to God. How has faith played a role in your life?
",3
"Yeah, it plays a huge role in my life. It always has. I think I really found my faith. My
",3
"father's parents, my grandparents were killed in the car wreck when I was 10. And this sounds silly,
",3
"but I mean, I was a 10-year-old kid, and I remember thinking maybe that it was my fault because I didn't pray enough.
",3
"So I started to practice of faith at that point. I'm not a huge fan of organized religion.
",3
"I think there's a lot of faults with it, but I know what my faith is and I practice my faith,
",4
"and it's a huge part of my routine. It's a huge part of my habit, and it's something that I go back to
",3
"every day. When people can get nervous when you start talking about spiritual fitness,
",3
"because they seem to think that it's religiosity, that doesn't necessarily have to be.
",3
"You know, your spiritual fitness is really your fitness around those things that bring your life
",4
"meaning and hope. I find a lot of that through my faith in God. I find a lot of that through all
",3
"those things that we've talked about before, doing hard things, routines and habits that really make
",3
"me who I am. So that's played a huge role in my life and continues through today.
",3
"That's amazing. Is it Bible-based for you?
",3
"You know, I read the Bible when I was younger. Really what I have now is I have a book of prayers
",4
"that I got from a Catholic chaplain prior to my first deployment. I kept in my body armor with
",3
"me on every deployment and really got into the routine of going through this book of prayers.
",3
"I have a routine of prayers that I'll say every day, you know, pray before I go to bed at night.
",4
"So it's really more of an inner thing for me. My wife and I, we beat ourselves up constantly,
",3
"because we don't go to church a lot, and it's something that we wish we did more.
",3
"We always seem to find a way to be too busy to do it, which is a poor excuse. It's something we need
",3
"to get better at. But it's built on that foundation of faith that came from the Bible when I was
",3
"younger and really is sustained through this book of prayers that I have. That's awesome.
",3
"So last question. What's next for you? What else is big on the radar this year?
",3
"What's next for me is, you know, bringing Wars of Quiet Waters Foundation as far as I can. We got
",4
"we got a really good vision in terms of where we want to go as an organization.
",3
"So that's one part of it. We're making, we're in the midst of making a bunch of changes to our
",3
"existing program to bring in these aspects of those pillars of the thriving life that I talked about
",3
"into our other other programs or fly fishing programs and things like that.
",3
"You know, so bringing this organization and maxing out its potential as much as I can. The
",4
"problem that we're facing is huge. There's 1.7 million post-911 combat veterans.
",3
"You know, 74,000 have been wounded physically. Over 700,000 have experienced symptoms of PTSD.
",3
"And PTSD isn't something that you get healed from. It's a matter of managing those symptoms and being
",3
"learned to live with them. And we, you know, there's a cohort of about 200,000 active duty service
",4
"members that volunteered right after 9-11, stayed in the military for their entire career 20 years
",3
"plus in a time of war. Those 200,000 are getting ready to come out now too and we've got to be
",3
"ready for that. So, you know, making doing everything that I can to help Wars of Quiet
",4
"Waters Foundation achieve its full potential and help veterans thrive. That's number one.
",3
"Number two is making sure that my kids are thriving. My older sons graduating here in about a week
",3
"and going to Montesda University to get an engineering degree and really supporting him in
",3
"every way that I can with that. Helping my younger son Gabe figure out what that looks like for him
",3
"because he's not quite there yet. Tyler figured it out early on. Gabe, you know, he's a totally
",4
"different kid than his brother and has a different interest in really trying to help him
",3
"form a pretty good idea of what that's like for him. And that's something that I didn't have when I,
",3
"you know, was at age. Like I said, I didn't know what I was going to do. Staying in Montana.
",4
"It was, you know, I want to try to help him come to a little more clear sense of what a,
",4
"you know, a thriving life looks like for him. Are either of them thinking military?
",4
"Tyler's definitely not. I've always tried to make sure my kids know what their opportunities are
",4
"but didn't try to push the military thing on either one of them. So, you know, I sent Tyler
",4
"to a couple of wrestling camps at the Naval Academy when we were out on the East Coast just to expose
",3
"him to that place. And I've talked to him about ROTC and things like that, but he is zero interest
",3
"at all. You know, he knows what he wants to do. He's going to get a mechanical engineer and degree
",4
"from MSU. Then he's going to go to Embry Riddle and get a master's degree in aerospace engineering.
",3
"And then he's going to work for NASA. That's what he wants to do. He's focused. Gabe,
",3
"Gabe has showed some inclination towards potentially the military and I'll take the same
",3
"approach. Know his options are, you know, what that looks like, answer every question that he has.
",4
"If he decides to do it, then I'm going to push him to special operations route because I want to
",3
"serve him with the best. But, you know, it's nothing that I'm going to really force on in any way.
",4
"So, you know, not just, you know, what's life look like for me going forward, you know, being a
",4
