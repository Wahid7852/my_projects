You know that?
He's like, yeah, I knew it was going to be him the whole time.
You know, came from pretty humble beginnings.
You know, started out underground and then went to school.
You know, was a typical kid.
You know, I wasn't, I was, I tell everybody, you know, I didn't start out as an athlete.
You know, I was a, I had a good life despite our humble beginnings and really found sports,
And that really put me on a trajectory to, to ultimately, you know, I think joining the
You know, had a couple of great seasons with the Butte High Bulldogs.
but it was still a great experience and really, you know, made high school what it was for me.
But, you know, originally my plan was to never leave Montana.
Ultimately was going to, you know, get an engineering degree and find a way to stay here
you know what, you need to stop talking about it and do something about it.
Had to make the decision if I was going to, you know, hang around and be waiting for the
worked for, you know, told me they'd work to get me back to Alaska or something like that.
Because they knew that Long Beach wasn't my, wasn't my jam.
Wasn't sure, you know, if I was doing the right thing.
And then like I said, if you know, that friend finally convinced me that if I didn't do it,
You know, so once again, you know, planning one for four years.
And once again, that plan was I was going to get out, but, you know,
I moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, and, you know,
And then just like before, you know, thinking about getting out,
I'm like, well, you know, I'm going to an independent battalion.
This was, you know what, four months before 9-11.
On the ground, you know, an organization that I'd stood up from the ground level.
You know, as you know, the ground war went pretty quick.
which really gave me a lot of pride because I knew how hard the Marines have worked.
You know, and to become really good at aircraft.
And then, you know, even though we were initially told we weren't going back about three months
Six months. So, you know, did that deployment, OIF-2,
you know, we were trying to figure it out just like everybody else when it came to counter-insurgency.
You know, Fallujah blew up while we were there.
This was a guy that I taught as an instructor. I remember when he came to the school, you know,
You know, I was, I went from being an operations officer to, I got an assignment at the Pentagon
Pentagon can be a drag for a while. Went from there to, you know, at the Naval War College,
Chairman's Office of Re-Integration. I'm like, what's that? He's like, I don't know. But here's
general officers. And basically they straightened me out. They said, you know what Brian, I understand
intent to do that. And it ended up being, you know, life changing event for me. Number one, it was
Was a brand new colonel, the, you know, the little guy on the, on the totem pole goes where
And my wife and I struggled with that a little bit because, you know,
you know, you're this outsider. And that kind of really shaped the way that I decided to take
Ultimately, that didn't be the case. That wasn't the case. You know, I was,
from there. You know, built the vision for what the training center needed to be and started putting
in motion a campaign plan to achieve that. And, you know, I knew it was working when, when my Marines
ultimately ended up using my words against me to do things that they wanted to do. You know, one of
the things that I, that I told them all was, you know, it's a, it's a mindset I call win every day.
then you're winning. You know, the, the, the theory of the aggregate of incremental gains tells
better than you are. So, you know, that doesn't sound as mountable. It's easy. We can get 1%
So, you know, that was one of the things that I pushed was constant improvement on what we do,
And ultimately ended up having a, you know, a really successful tour there and learned a ton.
You know, it, for me personally, you know, the Marines that come through that process,
every three, you know, three times a year going through assessment selection, ultimately ended
up, you know, selecting only 30 to 40. Yeah. And every one of those 230 Marines were awesome Marines.
operations officer. And then, you know, other special operations, advanced courses that run the
that gate. Yeah. You know, so that we spent a lot of time really working on the culture,
establishing, you know, what it was we wanted our Marines to be and do, what we wanted our
itself. You know, we spent a lot of time really trying to define what that meant through surveys
You know, so I was at the top, I wouldn't say I ran, but I was a senior staff officer on about a
veterans issues. And I'd known a board member from Warriors and Quiet Waters from a previous

him, you know, from the perspective that, you know, I got a problem. I'd like to talk to you about it.
said, you know, after Brian, this place will fall apart without you. I'm like, damn, this is not going
to go good. But over the course of about about a 30 minute conversation, you know, he came around to
Coming home to Montana was always what was going to happen no matter what. So, you know, this was
the perfect circumstances coming together for my family and I, you know, so it was easy, easy,
you know, that's something else I learned on the work with veterans on the joint staff.
You know, that's the huge role that purpose serves in the lives of service members and veterans.
the military, we all have a hierarchy of needs. You know, there are all things that we need to
thrive from the most basic needs like food and water, we got to have a job. You know, we need
connection because we're human beings that, you know, evolved into being social animals.
And ultimately, we, you know, we have to have, you know, some sense of pride in who we are and we
rebuild the hierarchy of needs from the gig. You know, a lot of veterans, the first thing that
they're concerned about is getting a job, you know, because they got to take care of themselves and
Big fears. Big fears. You know, what am I going to do to replace that sense of purpose that I had?
So I learned that. And I've been able to, to, to receive that, you know, in huge quantities,
being, you know, the executive director of an organization that helps post-9th element combat
bed and be excited about every single day. You know, it's more than just the bottom line of some
Not hard to get behind that. Yeah. Change in lives, save in lives. Yeah. So, you know, I'm blessed
I tell everybody it went smooth. And, you know, I had, I had peers, other colonels, Navy captains
You know, I was falling into a job where, where in a lifestyle where that was exactly what I wanted.
Plus, you know, a job and then plus the lifestyle that I'd longed for ever since I've been in the
You know, and, you know, I had known some people in the community, other, other service members
that I served with in the community. So I had those ties. And then, you know, the, the opportunity
you're not going to be doing that, you know, that stuff that was ultimately the stuff that kept you
their job? Yeah. So I think that, you know, that that's not something that everybody's going to be
is figuring out what that is. You know, what is going to bring your life meaning? You know,
you know, putting that uniform on, wearing an eagle globe and anchor over my heart. Yeah. That was a
you know, going through the self reflection and the hard thinking to really understand where you
You know, how are you going to do that as a veteran? If you have to do something that doesn't,
you know, for, for, for a paycheck that doesn't give you the opportunity to do that. Yeah. You know,
my purpose is service and leadership. You know, I'm blessed with the opportunity where I can do
that in my job. But if I didn't have this job, there'd be other ways to do that. You know, there
are a lot of, a lot of great organizations out there that allow me to serve and lead. You know,
worries and quiet waters is what I'm, I'm employed there, but there are others, you know, I'll name
one, the Travis Manning Foundation. You know, they have a program called the character does matter
and leadership to, to, to youth. You know, so that's one way you can do it. There's, you know,
especially to find their why. And we know that, we know that sometimes you just need to artificially
create that why until a bigger why takes its spot. So a lot of guys know that finding their why is
I started hunting like most kids in Montana do because my parent, my dad did. You know,
you know, have fun hunting. But ultimately, it became a lot more for that, more than that for me.
to know, even as a son. But he was a different person hunting. I mean, he'd tell stories, he'd
laugh, he was just very open. So I, you know, that's one of the reasons that hunting became so
guy, so it was always raffle hunting. But, you know, that was that one thing I was looking forward
to every year is, you know, the fall, getting here and getting home for a week hunt. And then,
I didn't, you know, I went to combat, saw the things that I did. And, you know, I was pretty

Park. And I remember standing over that elk after that deployment and thinking, you know,
up a bow again and really focused on archery hunting from that on. And, you know, archery hunting
But since then, you know, my love for archery hunting is what gives me year-round drive to
I'm present and I'm taking care of those things that my family needs, that, you know, they're
getting from me what they need so that I have the time in the fall to go hunting. You know,
I'm going to the mountains and her being okay with that. You know, so it ensures that I'm just
reinforce that. You know, so spend some time reflecting on, you know, what's my life going to be
And the science shows that, you know, when you're doing things like that, recreation in nature,
you fully immersed. As you know, you got to be present as an archery elk hunter. You got to be
that they live in. And really, that's, you know, those are the ingredients that they're thriving,
they're looking for. So, you know, create the, I call them these learning moments,
You know, that was the first thing that we talked about when the first week of hunt for purpose
and really staying engaged. You know, some are dealing with injuries, things like that. So we've
it, you know, with a couple of them, it's the right thing at the right time for them, you know,
where they're really, they're going through a life transition where, you know, they're really
struggling about, you know, what is my future look like. And I think it's really, it's really

You know, they're ordinary people who've done and seen extraordinary things.
they, you know, they got to struggle with like we all do. But they're not broken, they're not
victims. And what we try to do is to remind every one of them, you know, think about that person
you were on your best day in the military, you know, when you were, you were at the top of your
and let them go. You know, that's where that sense of purpose comes. I fundamentally believe
that's what post-Nile Island veterans are. And, you know, I think if, if we're able to help veterans
to be outside because we know that it'll create that, that, that dopamine rush and, and lead to
big challenge for guys this year is do something really hard outside. Yeah. You know, that's,
that's where some places I arrived at over time. Like I said, you know, you stay
that, you know, that, that drive, that, you know, doing hard things gave me was a big part of who
I was. I mean, let's be honest, it was part of my identity. So, you know, doing hard things is a
of hearing from their dad and do hard things. You need more grit. But, you know, I fundamentally
believe that's an essential aspect of people's lives and we'll be able to thrive. You know, I think,
I think as human beings, you know, that's built into us. And it's a matter of really,
you know, figuring out where those frontiers are and pushing to them and hopefully beyond them.
And I'm, so I'm not surprised that they, you know, that they find the training itself more
meaningful than the actual experience because, you know, that's really where you're able to push
You know, through and it creates habits, which are really the, you know, I look back at my success
and, you know, number one, it's the people that I worked with without a doubt. You know, a lot of
people that worked for me, you know, that that's the number one key, but the second was being able
to build routines and habits that, you know, gave me a work ethic that made me do the hard things

you know, these are professionals that, you know, they've spent their lives figuring out how to
optimize human performance in that cognitive domain. So they, you know, that was a huge part of it.
