Yeah, the Jack Carr one was pretty fun.
He's super nice.
He seems like a really intriguing dude.
And he's everywhere now.
I mean, I see him all over the place.
Yeah, really authentic and it's funny because he's very strategic about like his life plan.
Oh, really?
Which is probably more strategic than anyone I've ever met because I asked him like if
he ever planned on having a famous like Amazon show come out about his book.
It was part of the plan the whole time.
Seriously?
Holy cow.
We're like, did you ever think you'd find Chris Pratt to play the leading role?
Holy cow.
Wow.
Is it out yet?
I haven't seen it.
I think it's coming out in July.
I'm looking forward to watching it.
It's going to be awesome.
The books were good.
Yeah, the detail in them is pretty amazing.
Absolutely.
It's just a cool story that I did that.
How he got into it after a career in NSW.
All the like detail he was able to do.
Well, I'm not surprised now here what you told me about his strategic plan.
I wish I was so strategic because it wasn't that at all.
Some of his buddies say like they think he was a seal just so he had all the details
to write really good books.
Like he's that detailed that that was part of his plan.
To have.
Sounds like it was.
Sounds like it was.
Pretty wild.
That's pretty cool.
So, let's start with your story.
What was your childhood like?
Where'd you come from?
Where'd you grow up?
I'm a Montana kid.
I grew up in Butte, Montana.
West of Bozeman here.
My dad was a ranch ham when he met my wife.
He grew up out in the Ruby Valley.
My family's been out there for five generations.
Met my mom on a blind date.
They got married and then he moved to Butte and started working in the mine.
Was an underground miner initially.
And worked for them his entire career.
Ultimately became a chemist and then worked in the laboratory doing assays on all the
samples from the mine.
So it started pretty humble beginnings.
things like that later about my freshman year in high school.
Started martial arts when I was younger.
Ultimately got into sports and really, really got a lot out of that.
Graduated from Butte High was a football athlete.
Although we lost our state championship in the junior and senior year, it was tough,
And then got recruited by Coach Green at Montana Tech to walk on to the football team.
It wasn't good enough to get a scholarship, but he called me in the summer and asked me to
walk on.
I'd already planned to go to Montana Tech for college.
Started out as a computer science major, ultimately ended up switching over to engineering.
The diggers, huh?
And Coach Green was a big influence.
And that plays a part in my story a little bit later.
I love where I came from.
in Montana working.
And honestly, it was a conversation that I had with a friend about halfway through my
senior year in college.
Just do it.
Crazy.
So I did.
This was pre-911.
I ultimately went on and graduated from Tech.
I'd been offered a job as an engineer in Long Beach, California.
So chemical engineering degree?
Environmental engineering.
Long Beach, California.
I remember my first flight on an airplane was when I flew down to Long Beach to, for the
interview.
First flight ever.
First flight ever.
Never been on an airplane prior to that.
And then moved from Butte, Montana, 30,000 people to Los Angeles County, 11 million people.
Pretty, pretty big culture shock.
It had a desk job.
I mean, I was working on the 11th floor of a tower in downtown,
downtown Long Beach, California.
We're in a suit and tie care in a briefcase.

So I called my parents and told them I was quitting my engineering job and going to
Oxford Canada school.
They both thought I was crazy.
get a master's in geological engineering and stay in Montana again.
That was 27, 28 years ago now.
So I went in for four years, ultimately I ended up staying for just under 27.
Was your family like grandfathers in the military?
I had some great uncles that served in World War II.
I had an uncle that did a brief stint in the Army, but that was about it.
It wasn't part of my family history really.
My dad couldn't serve because he had a physical disability in his arm.
Something that he told me he always wanted to do, but he couldn't.
I'd probably regret it.

You go through Oxford Canada school or another commissioning program like ROTC, something like that.
Then you'll all officers end up at the basic school, which is a six-month course that every
the esprit and camaraderie that we have.
Everybody has that shared experience on the enlisted side as well with basic training
So got through the basic school, went through the infantry officers course.
called Ground Intel.
And the idea, it was based on the lessons learned from the Gulf War,
where they needed their intel officers to have more of an operational focus.
So we went to the infantry officer course first, then we went to Intel school,
With the idea that we'd eventually progress into ground reconnaissance and then do
intel intelligence staff jobs along the way.
did a couple deployments on naval shipping.
This was prior to 9-11.
Did two six-month deployments at sea like that.
Came back and that was the end of my four years.
What year was this?
This was 1999.
Okay.
Offered me an opportunity to be an instructor.
I thought that sounds pretty interesting.
I think I'll give that a shot.
So I did and about a year into that instructor job in an army school,
ground intelligence officer course.
And I raised my hand and said, I'll do that.
So they picked me.
spent the next seven months standing up this military occupational specialty course for new
officers.
Writing all the curriculum had one other captain that was working with me.
And then I was a course director for that course for two years.
I remember writing in my journal about getting ready to come home in Montana.
So I just got married.
And I remember driving across the country from Virginia Beach, Virginia to Camp Pendleton,
California.
This was pre-911.
But close, right?
Getting close.
Getting really close.
This was 2001, July 2001.
And that's really unlikely.

Crazy.

So 9-11 changed all that.
So I had the really unique opportunity to build the team from the ground level.
On the ground.
We're going home and we're going to get ready for the next one.
redeployed him home.
after we got back, hey, you're going back again in six months.
So I met my oldest son when he was six months old when I got back from that deployment.
The really great thing about it is I have a picture of meeting him for the first time,
which is in my calling.
Six months.
The things in Iraq were getting pretty bad at the time, as I'm sure you can recall.
he had guns and he didn't want to store them on base. He brought the guns over my house to store them.
Crazy.
for a company that was moving from our forward operating base to a temporary fob.
And it ended up coming into an ambush. First vehicle got nailed by a machine gun fire and
rocket propelled grenades. Brett was the second vehicle in the convoy, told his driver to come
to a halt, grabbed the Marines and his vehicle and sprinted over the berm into the teeth of the
fire, took around ultimately through the lower abdomen, ultimately ended up dying.
Crazy.
that's always, that's been one of those tough things for me. So that's the bracelet that I
similarly. They kept offering opportunities. I kept saying, yeah, that sounds pretty neat.
ground reconnaissance capability. Did that for three years, learned a ton. One of those experiences
that you're really glad you did it, but you're really glad it's over because working in the
spent a year studying as a student, getting a master's degree, which was a great opportunity
shorter six month deployment, this was the end of the surge. So President Obama was starting to
pull people home. We were one of those units that were redeployed early. Ultimately ended
But we started out as battle space owners in the Sangan Valley. The battalion that proceeded us,
they drove the enemy out of the area of operations that we got assigned. So it was a
relatively benign AO. We spent a lot of time building capacity within the local government,
trying to tie the locals to the government. Then ultimately halfway through our deployment got
pulled out, got sent back down to Camp Leatherneck. We started conducting long range raids for the
division into areas that typically didn't have any any coalition force presence. So
we'd work up an area for about a week and conduct the hellbore raid. Just go in there and really
conduct, try to disrupt the enemies, whether it was a rat lines or other operations that they had
finished this deployment. Went from there back to the joint staff as a Lieutenant Colonel. And
I'd originally been assigned to go to the White House to be on the national security staff.
Ultimately that didn't work out, but that process got drug out so long that by the time the
I graduated from the Army War College in May. Crazy. So they moved me to Washington, D.C.
and just had me kind of just marking time, waiting for the slot on the national security staff to
open up. Finally by the end of July, they called me and said, we're going to combat on this.
What do you want to do? The military moves in seasons, people start moving early spring.
Most of the moves are done by mid-summer. So I'm like, well, what's left? Because everybody's already
moved. And my assignments officer told me, there's a job in the operations director
of the joint staff, you're already in D.C. I'm like, okay, I'll take that. That sounds pretty good.
So next day, went in and reported on the joint staff. And I remember
checking in and there's an Air Force Chief Foreign Officer there at the Joint Staff
Personnel Office and tells me, you're not going to the G3. You're going to the
your boss's number. You give him a call and he'll tell you. So my boss was a guy on Army
crew by the name Eisenhower. So I called him and he explained to me that this was an office that
the chairman, Admiral Mullen, stood up when he was the chairman with the intent for it to lead
the DUD's efforts to help transition military service members and veterans reintegrate back
into society. He had saw all of these nonprofits, all these corporations doing a lot to try to help
veterans return to civilian society after war. But he didn't see the Department of Defense
doing a lot. So he stood up this office within his office of the chairman, put five field grade
officers in it and said, your job is to create effective reintegration pathways for veterans.
When I first heard this, I was like, whoa, this is so far from anything I've ever done.
Yeah. I started, I went home and I called the, you know, I called some mentors. I called a couple
your concerns, but you need to boom where you're planning. So I went back the next day with the
incredibly meaningful experience working with all these nonprofit organizations, all these
corporations trying to help veterans reintegrate and the opportunity to interact with thousands
and thousands of veterans that were going through this really challenging transition process.
So I learned a ton, did that for three years. Ultimately ended up getting orders from there
because it was a brand new colonel got promoted right at the end of that tour.
everybody else doesn't want to go. I got orders to do Okinawa, Japan, third brain division.
it was a tough time. My father just died and my wife's family, my wife's family couldn't travel
overseas for a bunch of different reasons. So like three years away, this is a really bad time.
But ultimately we decided it was the right thing to do. And I told them, I told the assignment's
to Okinawa, Japan with, with third brain division. And the day I was unpacking my household goods,
Marsock and I'd be going home in nine months. What was supposed to be a three year tour and
being about a 10 month tour. It was still a great tour. Third brain division was an awesome place
they're training all the time in Japan, Japan. Yeah. Was an awesome experience, probably the
Special Operations Command was the day I took command in one of its major subordinate elements.
So a pretty daunting task as you can imagine. Opportunity to interact with a guy who ultimately
ended up being a really good friend of mine, another colonel that I'd met at the command
And he basically told me you're going to have a mutiny on your hands because he got,
command. And why were you considered an outsider? Because I'd not, this was, this was at the time
Everybody that came into the, into the Mars Lock at that point were being assessed and selected.
Which makes sense given my background. But he just thought that that would be a problem.
I was pretty deliberate about listening a lot, really figuring things out before I decided that
we needed to make any changes. Ultimately, really coming to a really clear understanding of what it
If you're improving what you do, if you're improving yourself personally and professionally,
improving your fighting hole, that place that you work every single day, just a little bit,
you that if you improve what you do by 1% a day at the end of the year, you're going to be 10 times
of that. Maybe not every day, but still over time that aggregates, you're going to get a lot better.
we were giving them everything that they need in terms of training in the way that they needed it.
So you can imagine the caliber of the individuals that were working with that organization
and just being exposed to that and seeing the things that they were capable of doing.
Yeah. Really gave me the opportunity to really push the edges in terms of what we're doing training
wise and really make some big gains and really do a lot of good for the organization because I had
that caliber of people. Were you overseeing selection and training? Yeah. So I had assessment
selection and then I had 14 different special operations courses that the training center
ran everything from the individual training course, which was the course that everybody
goes through once they're selected to qualify either as a critical skills operator or a special
gamut from CQB courses to breaching courses and everything in between. So all the formal training
one of the things that I keyed on when I took command was when my division or when
organization to be and do. And that ultimately ended up bubbling up into the entire command. So
that was a really meaningful experience as well as getting the opportunity to influence the culture
and other things like that, understanding what the Marines thought the culture was and then
building on that from there. So that was a great, a great tour. Did two years of command there,
was selected by the commanding general to be his chief of staff on the commitment that I'd
stand that job for two years as the chief. It was a great job. I mean, it was one of those jobs
where your job is related to ensure that what the commanding general wants to get done gets done.
responsible for synchronizing and integrating all the organization, all the activities of the staff
and the subordinate commands to a lesser extent to achieve the commanding general's vision.
And I was about a year into that. And I got a call from a buddy that told me this organization,
Boseman, Montana, Warriors and Quiet Waters Foundation was looking for a new executive
director. This was an organization that I learned about when I was on the joint staff working
introduction. So I called him and I said, Hey, I hear Warriors and Quiet Waters is looking for a
new ED. Do you think I'd be a good fit? He thought about it for about two seconds. He told me,
throw your name in the hat. So I did that. Didn't tell my boss because I wasn't sure how I was going
to work out. And I've gone through the interview process and ultimately was offered the job.
Corps yet. I still have another year as it is the chief of staff at Marsox. And I was going to take
another another another move and do three more years to get me to 30 years. That was the plan.
But I had about a five minute conversation with my wife, Marianne. Yeah, this is the right thing.
We got to go for it. That I was worried about telling my boss, the major general that I worked
was going to be leaving at the end of that year. And he wanted the chief to be there for continuity
And I remember when he when I first told him that I've been offered this job, he looked at me and
realize that it was the right thing and told me, yeah, I think you should do it. All in the same
conversation. Crazy. Well, I mean, just to show you, Calvary leader, he was yeah, major general, you
four months and moved here in June of 2020. Took over on July 6th, that is the executive director
of the Quiet Waters Foundation. And like I said, it was perfect. I learned when I was on the joint
a lot of purpose there. I mean, keeping guys on mission, getting them back on mission. Yeah. So,
And the way I like to tell people about it is this, if you think about it, when people come into
the military strips all that stuff that you had away. They break you down as an individual.
They build you back up as a member of the team. And then they issue you that, issue you that
hierarchy needs. They take care of it all for you. Yeah. They take care of your house and your food.
They take care of all your training and professional development. They give you very, very clear
purpose and admission. And you have that for the entire time that you're in the military. Yeah.
And that's what your experience is, a very strong sense of purpose about what you do.
But when you leave the military, that's all stripped away. And you're essentially left to
their family. And that job doesn't necessarily always provide that purpose that they found
is being a member of the military. And this, this, this can create huge issues for veterans.
veterans thrive. It gives me a sense of purpose every single day. Something that I can get out of
company. It's having a meaningful impact on hundreds and thousands of other individuals.
because of that. Did you have some of the transitional struggles your own or did years go
just really smooth because of you just went from purpose to purpose? Yeah. I mean, I, I,
that told me I was getting out that, Hey dude, your first year is going to suck. Just be ready for
that. But I didn't experience that at all. And I think that's because I had that purpose again.
interact with veterans on a day to day basis. It was all built right in. So I didn't experience that
myself. I'd say my transition is going pretty smooth. Now, yeah, there's things that I miss.
I mean, I, I miss the Marines. I miss the training. I miss those kinds of opportunities. But, you know,
harder physically every day. As you can imagine, after 27 years, a bunch of combat deployments,
the body started to break down and things like that. So you, I mean, you got to recognize that
in initially forever. Seasons. Yeah. So what are you telling folks now that are getting out that
aren't exactly blessed to find that purpose at their job? How are they finding that outside of
able to find in a job. Yeah. At the end of the day, you have to have an occupation so you can take
care of your family, be financially stable, have a future. And you may not, you may not be as lucky
as I am where you found that opportunity to get that sense of purpose from there. But you don't
have to get your sense of purpose, in my opinion, from, from your occupation. There are lots of
other ways where you can find that. And I think that the hardest part for veterans to grapple with
huge part of who I was. How are you going to replace that identity? And I think it's really,
think you're going to find that new identity and that new purpose, if you can't find it in your job.
that allows retired and former service members to find that purpose through teaching character
it's really a matter of figuring out what that, what that purpose is. And then you can build it
from there. Yeah. And you can build it from there. And what is, I love the concept of your hunt for
purpose initiative because in my mind with Mountain Tough, we're always working with guys,
going to get them on track, get them focused. But sometimes you have to artificially create one
to get the wheels in motion. And so I think your hunt for purpose initiative does a pretty
beautiful job of that with physical fitness, mental fitness, nutrition, shooting your bow.
So how did you set that up? I mean, that came from my experiences as a hunter.
and it was a fun time for me to go and hang out with my cousins and my uncles and my dad and,
My dad was probably the world's biggest introvert and stoic. Didn't talk a lot. Really hard to get
important to me early on was because it gave me an opportunity to really connect with my dad
my opportunities to hunt became less and less. So I'd come home for a year. My dad was an archery
saw some others, some others wounded, but didn't have some of the experiences that so many others
trip back home after combat was on a hunt. I wasn't with my dad that day on the mountain because
he was older. He typically stayed in the truck at that point. He dropped me off, picked me up.
Ended up killing an elk in a snowstorm in the Greenhorn Mountains in a place that I call Salis
I'm honest, this may sound cheesy, but I've never felt closer to God than I did in that moment.
And I really understood really what hunting did for me and really being able to find clarity,
find some peace and make meaning of those things that I experienced in combat.
And I continued to go to that for the rest of my career, come home. My dad died in 2015, so I picked
stand shape. Gives me year-round drive to make sure that when I'm not hunting, I'm at home and
I do things like go to the symphony with my wife and the opera and play because it's important
and I want to earn that opportunity when September rolls around to step aside and say, honey,
getting better in every domain of my life because I'm an archery elk hunter. And it was that experience
that gave me the idea for hunting for purpose. Warriors in Quiet Waters exist to help post-9
11 combat veterans thrive. And I think in order for veterans to thrive, they have to be living a
meaningful life, a life of purpose. And I realized because in my experience as a hunter, what I gained
from that coming home from combat, that that was something that we could use to help post-9
11 combat veterans find more clarity on the answers to those big questions. Who am I? What can I do?
What do I value? And what's going to bring my life purpose? And using that using archery elk hunting
as a mechanism to do that because like you said, we've integrated holistic wellness into it. You
we've brought in an integrated nutrition coach that talks to them about their nutrition because
of the gut brain connection and the profound impact that the food that you eat has on your
physical health and your mental health. It's huge. We've brought in through Mountain Tough and
in your all's partnership with us to focus on always being ready physically for what's going
to come your way in the mountains. And then we've brought in other partners like the Commit Foundation
that has helped have helped us bring them through this guided discovery process where
they're they're spending a lot of time really thinking about these big questions on identity
values, potential and purpose. Is a deliberate part of the program where we're guiding them
through exercises to think about this stuff. And then we're using archery elk hunting to
going forward and then going through on a ruck on your back and going doing an archery course.
whether it be archery elk hunting, whether it be fly fishing, which is the core activity that we do
at Ores and Quiet Waters, in nature, it does some specific things for the human. The first thing
it does is it distracts you from your day to day challenges because it's an activity that's keeping
present when you're behind that bow. You got to be present when you're closing in, all that.
And then it provides you comfort because it's an enjoyable activity. And those two things together,
the research shows gives you a dopamine dump. And then the combination of that distraction,
that comfort and that dopamine makes humans better problem solvers. It makes them more creative.
It gives them a better outlook on life. It makes them more vital. They're more engaged in the world
create these learning moments where we can create the conditions for our participants to have epiphanies
about what their, what their, what a life of meaning and purpose looks like going forward,
by capitalizing on those physical and physiological and psychological things that happen to the human
when you're spending time in nature and immersive activity like archery elk hunting. So that's the
whole idea. So hunt for purpose is a six month program where we're bringing our participants
back here three separate times, started back in March where we had the initial week where it was
really about getting them all their equipment, getting them fitted on their bows, getting them
trained on how to use them, spending some time with their rucks on their back, teaching them
archery elk hunting skills while we're going through this guided discovery process around
those pillars of the thriving, thriving, thriving life, identity, potential purpose and values.
So we spent the first week kind of is a ramp up week doing that. It's when we first engage with
you all in the workouts, really got them moving on that. And then they went home. And in the time
that they've been home, they continue to meet on a weekly basis with their volunteer companions.
So these are the battle buddies that are going through this with them. They can continue to
engage in Mountain Tuff's app to make sure they're staying up on their workouts, they continue to
engage with our integrated nutrition coach, Karen Mitchell. And we've given them some other online
tools like the elk 101 elk university where they can continue to hone their archery elk hunting
skills. They'll come back here the first week of June for what we're calling hunt for purpose boot
camp, which will be a week long, really intense experience where we're really going to dial them
up on their archery elk hunting skills. We're going to finish that guided discovery process
around those pillars of the thriving life. And then they're going to go home after that first week
or after that second week, and then they'll continue that remote work while they're home with
their companions. And they'll come back in September and they'll do a week long archery elk hunt.
So it's amazing. Yeah. So we're splitting the hunters into two different cohorts in September.
So there'll be two different hunt weeks, really two unique experiences, one on a private ranch
with a landowner who's always supported boards of quiet waters and the second cohort will be
in the bottom of Marshallville in a sudden. That's amazing. And it's a serious deal, right?
Like if they're skipping workouts and not taking this thing serious, they can just get kicked off
the group. We can't make them do anything. We've asked them to make commitments so right up front.
kicked off was that this wasn't going to be easy. And we're asking you all to commit.
And then doing it at a cohort, then you have that camaraderie. And you also have that pure
accountability. And that's the idea of keeping them connected while they're home. We keep them
connected around Google Classroom, different social media, and Zoom calls. So that pure
accountability sticks. And we've seen it really, we haven't had to ask them to. I mean, they've
been committed. They've been doing the work, all the physical training work through your app.
They've been connecting with Karen, our nutrition coach. They've been connecting with their
companions and talking about the challenges that they're having going through the program
asked them to back off a little bit so they're ready for the boot camp when they get, when
June rolls around. But it hasn't been a matter of making them do it. They've went full into it.
And I really think it's that camaraderie, that pure accountability and the opportunity that we're
offering them to really figure out what a life of purpose looks like going forward.
Are you seeing some life change already?
Yeah. I mean, based on some of the discussions that we had after the first week,
some conversations with a couple of the local participants that I've had here,
helped them a lot, become a lot more clear on that. I think it's also reminded them of who they were.
They all come with their own unique set of challenges based on their own individual
experiences that they had. And the problem with a lot of the discussions around veterans,
in my opinion, in America is that it falls at one or two extremes, either everybody's a hero,
have a, an affinity to the military through a close connection, they're going to fall in one of
those two areas. And the fact is that the vast majority of veterans aren't either of those.
And as a result of that, they've collected some residue, they've collected some challenges that
game, that person's still there. It's just a matter of finding them. It's a matter of scraping
that residue, finding that person again, and then figuring out which direction they need to point
thrive, then we're going to be better off as a country. Thriving veterans contribute to thriving
communities. And that means a better future for every one of us. Better America, yeah.
And with suicide at like an all-time high, depression at an all-time high, anxiety at an
all-time high, at Mount Tuff, we were spending a lot of time this year just challenging guys
to just get outside and do something hard. And we're, we're not even particular about what that
is. We just want them to put it on your calendar, do something really hard for you. And we need it
a life-changing moment. And just putting it on the calendar creates this
like Spartan effect where because it's on the calendar, now they're training for it. And then
the training sometimes is more transformational than the event itself. And that's kind of our
in shape and do hard things in the military a lot because it's what you have to do. And I
recognize that that was a piece of me that needed to continue once I, once I left. I mean, it could
have been easy not to do that kind of stuff. That would have been the easy answer. But I recognize
big part of my life. It's something I beat into my kids. I got two teenage boys, they're tired
yourselves to those limits with no real risk. But you're really going to learn a ton about yourself.
marathons and ultra marathons and looking back at those years that we did a lot of that,
in hindsight now, it was the training for those big events that was so special because it's like
the event is just one day, but it takes an entire summer of training to get ready for that event,
which changes the whole trajectory of your life because now you're on goal, on target,
all summer for something really big. Yeah. It builds discipline into your life. It really does.
people help me out a lot of different ways, people that I worked for, people that worked with me,
and do the hard work necessary to be successful. It's those routines and habits that have really
every day. I feel the same every day because of that. And I go home at the end of the day satisfied
If nothing else goes right that day, at least I got that done. So it's all part of those routines
and habits that are critical for me personally. And that's something that we're trying to bring
comes with building those routines and habits because motivation is fleeting. If you try to
do something because you're motivated to do it, you're ultimately going to fail because that
motivation is not going to stick around forever. It's really a matter of building the habits and
I get up early and work out every morning ultimately because I'm an archery Elkunter.
I'm really good about how I eat for the same reasons. And plus it makes me feel better.
I don't have information in my joints. I'm not dealing with that pain.
And that's been some trial and error that ultimately I arrived at. And
because I've established those routines and pretty much eating the same thing day after
day, it's become a habit and that's my discipline now. And I feel better as a result of it.
Usually six o'clock. At the home gym.
At the home gym. I bought a bunch of equipment back in 2013 and been working on it off in a gym
at home ever since. And I do it in the mornings because I can never predict how my day is going
to go. If I get it done in the morning, at least I got that done. Nothing comes up in the morning.
No barbecues, no conference calls. And that's where I've established that routine. I get up
pretty early. I get up before every day. I spend the first hour reading. So that's another discipline
that I follow. I said service and leadership is my purpose. I consider myself a student of
leadership forever. And reading is a big part of that practice. So I try to read every day.
And I'm not one of those guys that can roll right out of the rack and throw on my shoes and go
work out. I got to wake up. I got to get a cup of coffee in me. So that gives me about an hour to
get ready. About 5.30, 6 o'clock, I'm heading to the gym. Awesome. I wanted to back up on three things.
One is where were you at on 9-11? Where were you? What happened that day for you?
in Oceanside, California to work. I heard about it on the radio. It happened 9 o'clock East Coast
time. So this was 7 o'clock West Coast time. I heard about it. Called my wife, told her what
was happening, went into work. And the whole battalion was in a big spin. We're ordering maps
there was a lot of misinformation at the time. A lot of false reports about other attacks coming in.
Really, that's what we did. We spent that day watching on the TV ordering maps for Afghanistan
And where did you meet your wife at? I met her when I was an instructor out of Virginia Beach.
She had grown up in Ohio. She was living in Washington, DC, working for McKinsey and Company.
And she had an aunt and uncle that lived down Virginia Beach, Virginia. It just so happened
she went to college with the other captain that I mentioned that I was an instructor with.
us. So I met my wife at Crocs Bar in Virginia Beach, Virginia. That's awesome. Six months later,
we were married. Six months. Six months later. That's awesome. That was 22 years ago. Crazy.
22 years ago. Congratulations. That's great. And then I wanted to fast forward a little bit to a
30 of them making it through. What did you start to see and boil down to as far as the mental
toughness and grit, skills and lifestyle habits and mindfulness? What got some of those guys through?
What made some of those guys fail? What did you see there as general trends?
Yeah. So Marsock stole a lot from the other services in terms of their assessment selection.
Their last military service to stand up for a special operations command. So we stole a lot
from the Army, stole a lot from the Navy in terms of how we put assessment selection together. And
ultimately it boiled down to 10 attributes. And off the top of my head, I can't remember them all,
but leadership, integrity, mental toughness were three of those 10 attributes. And over the course
of a pretty long selection process, we collect about 5,000 points of data on every individual.
We had a software program that would take all that data in, and then it would display it in a way
that we could start assessing people's levels of these different attributes. So ultimately,
that's what we were selecting for those attributes. So the Marines that didn't make it through were
for a 10-pointed star. Those 10 attributes. Very specific. And a lot of really great Marines that
were physical studs didn't make it through for whatever reason. But there were givens that you
had to come to the table with. You had to be physically resilient because it's a long process.
You got to have endurance. You have to be physically capable. You had to be in shape because we're
asking you to move on long distances with a lot of weight on you. And you had to be mentally tough
because that's the key is that moving over that long distance with a lot of weight on you wasn't
the test. It was what you did in that process. We'd force you into making decisions. We'd force
you into leadership positions where you're on your physical edge and you still have to be able to
respond to a certain scenario in a certain way. And that's where that really came in was it was
more than just being able to do hard things. It was being able to function effectively on a cognitive
basis on a social basis because we throw them into social scenarios as well because that's
putting a big part in what special operations operators do. While you're under that physical
duress, while you're at that physical frontier, being able to perform in those other those other
domains was really what it boiled down to. So mental toughness played a huge role in that.
And it wasn't something that you were given the opportunity to build while your assessment
selection. It's something that you had to you had to foster as you came into it because the process
would weed you out really quick if you didn't have it really quick. So it's like
socially highly functional while under extreme physical duress. Yeah. A lot of it boiled down
Six weeks long. Two different phases. First phase is all known problems for the candidates where
they're told the event that they're going to do. They told they're told what the standard is
The second phase was exactly the opposite. We moved into a different location and everything was
And that's how pretty much that the second half was conducted. And you're doing all that in a team
environment. You were assigned a leadership role or not. And when you were assigned a leadership
role, you were being evaluated on your ability to lead your team through that problem set.
told what needs to get done and or get it solved. And then how you do it's up to you.
And like I said, a lot of uncertainty thrown into there. And that's once again,
where that mental toughness comes in as well, is being able to operate effectively in uncertainty.
Yeah, absolutely. And is there a hell week type event?
Mars selection assessment process. It's just a long build up of all these events
cumulatively that it comes to. There's something very similar to that in an individual training
courses broken down into four phases. And they have to get through what looks a lot like a hell
back getting very, very little sleep, being thrown a couple new problem sets every day in a team
environment. So not the same as hell week, but I think it achieves similar results. So that's
and that's a lot of a lot of heavy pack rocking work was happening there though, which
What kind of distances would you see?
Well, in that week that I talked about in the first phase, I want to try to remember,
I want to say they were moving over seven days close to 90 miles,
90 miles is about 90 pound packs. Crazy. So yeah, in assessment selection, the longest known distance
hike was 12 miles, 12 miles, and once again done to a time standard. So the Marines are walking.
I mean, in order to meet the standard, you're in a minimum shuffle. You're jogging. Yeah,
I'm going up against 20 year olds, there's no way I'm going to be at the front, but I was in the
front third, in the front third, because that's what I felt I needed to do as a leader, show up
and do that. I didn't make everyone, I didn't make every hike, but I tried to make as many as I could.
Yeah. So that was a huge component of it. Was there a little, like a mental toughness
hack or mindset hack or mind trick that you saw was helping a lot of those guys pass that?
Command was the psychological aspects of performance. Yeah. And Special Operations Command has figured
that were struggling, whether this was in the shoot house, whether it was in some other aspect
of the course where we could bring them together with this operational psychologist,
issue, whether that was being able to recognize the essence of the problem that they were facing,
through the lab. But just watching that on the daily basis, you start to see things that
most mentally tough people have. Like we call it, we always call it like they're positive when
everyone else is negative. You'll see that with the hunters. They'll be the guy that
when it's negative 20 and the snow is blowing in your face, he'll look at you and say,
at least it's not negative 30. But as soon as you make that mental switch, you're like,
yeah, I feel pretty good. Now, at least it's not negative 30. And so we start to kind of see those
key characteristics. We call that embrace the suck. Yeah. That's a huge part of it. I think
positivity is a huge part of it as well. Recognizing that things can always get worse.
And I go back to
something I learned about, God, the name's escaping me now.
Navy Admiral was a prisoner of war in Vietnam. And what he learned was the thing that set
those people that survived that experience apart from those that didn't were the optimists,
ultimately didn't survive because they would hope we're going to be home by Christmas.
And when that didn't happen, they'd lose all hope. And ultimately ended up dying. What he learned
was it was the pragmatists who were able to stay positive throughout it. They were able to accept
life circumstances as they are, but still maintain a positive attitude in terms of how it can get
better. Not putting all your buckets in this bag of hope that could get crushed,
being very pragmatic about the situation that you're in, but addressing it in a positive manner.
I think that's key. Yeah, that's in man's search for meaning. The people that set Christmas as that
goal were literally dying a few days after Christmas from their mind. We read the same book.
Yeah, it is. So what are you doing nowadays with your boys to teach some of this grit and
determination? Yeah, so I learned early on, my kids were, you got to do everything in small doses.
First time I brought my older son, Hunt, and it was a backcountry hunt. We
humped in the back country. Weather wasn't playing a great role. The wind was blowing like crazy
the whole time and really was wearing into him. I remember on, it was the end of day two, we'd
spent the whole day at high altitude hiking our butts off in this high winds. Finally get back to
camp and I look at him and you just tell he's defeated. He's just done. So I recognized, there's
going to shower up and then we'll come back tomorrow afternoon. As soon as I told him that,
his whole attitude changed. Life was positive. So everything in small doses, that's number one.
But I do ask him to do things that push their boundaries. And this is something I tried to
work on when they were really young. My son Tyler, my older son, I remember when we were in
Carlisle, Pennsylvania, when I was going to the Armoury World College. He's always been a smart
kid. Did real well in school. And I used to help him study math. We had a room above the garage
where we'd go up and pull out the whiteboard and put up problems for him. And he'd go through
them. I remember prepping for a test for one of them with him. And then he came home and I asked
him what I did on the test and he didn't do that great because he hadn't spent that time preparing.
And I told him one time, I said, Tyler, you're really talented kid, but you're talented. So far
you got to work hard too. And he took that and that's how he's lived his life ever since.
He's a national merit scholar and he honored me with the essay that he had to write for that
scholarship. And he wrote about those things that I taught him. And that was one of those things.
Doing hard things, the role the grid has in your life. And I've probably taken it to extremes.
We wrote this Gilman family maxim that it's about 15 lines of things that the males and
the Gilman family will do. I had them both sign it and commit to that. I go to it all the time.
When they're falling short of that standard, we'll go back and we'll pull out that Gilman
code of conduct and talk about what that means. I haven't had to do it recently in quite a while.
What's a few of the things on there?
A lot. I can't remember the verbiage. I'll send you a picture.
It talks a lot about discipline. It talks about how you treat other people.
It talks about being confident in yourself, understanding who you are, being proud of that,
a bunch of stuff like that, doing hard things. That's great.
So hunting trips are things that we do. I brought my family on a pretty good hike last summer.
We hiked up to Sunrise Lake in the tobacco roots, which is about 11,000 feet, about a
seven mile approach march. And it was a slog. It was a hot July day, but we kept on it and we made it happen.
And they've always seen me working out in the gym at home, and they've taken on that ethic.
Both my sons have. They both work out regularly. My older son's a pretty accomplished track athlete
now, and he attributes all of his success to the discipline and that work ethic that he learned as
a kid by doing hard things. So we did similar hikes in Okinawa, hiking upstream beds to waterfalls,
just doing hard things. It doesn't have to be huge doses of it, but push yourself a little
bit, get a little bit uncomfortable, and then embrace that. Embrace the fact that it's 95 and 100%
humidity and you're really tired. But hey, look at that awesome waterfall right there. That's pretty cool.
That's amazing. Stuff like that. Stuff like that. It's so great. And you mentioned on that Elkhont,
that last one with your dad, never feeling closer to God. How has faith played a role in your life?
Yeah, it plays a huge role in my life. It always has. I think I really found my faith. My
father's parents, my grandparents were killed in the car wreck when I was 10. And this sounds silly,
but I mean, I was a 10-year-old kid, and I remember thinking maybe that it was my fault because I didn't pray enough.
So I started to practice of faith at that point. I'm not a huge fan of organized religion.
and it's a huge part of my routine. It's a huge part of my habit, and it's something that I go back to
every day. When people can get nervous when you start talking about spiritual fitness,
because they seem to think that it's religiosity, that doesn't necessarily have to be.
meaning and hope. I find a lot of that through my faith in God. I find a lot of that through all
those things that we've talked about before, doing hard things, routines and habits that really make
me who I am. So that's played a huge role in my life and continues through today.
That's amazing. Is it Bible-based for you?
that I got from a Catholic chaplain prior to my first deployment. I kept in my body armor with
me on every deployment and really got into the routine of going through this book of prayers.
So it's really more of an inner thing for me. My wife and I, we beat ourselves up constantly,
because we don't go to church a lot, and it's something that we wish we did more.
We always seem to find a way to be too busy to do it, which is a poor excuse. It's something we need
to get better at. But it's built on that foundation of faith that came from the Bible when I was
younger and really is sustained through this book of prayers that I have. That's awesome.
So last question. What's next for you? What else is big on the radar this year?
we got a really good vision in terms of where we want to go as an organization.
So that's one part of it. We're making, we're in the midst of making a bunch of changes to our
existing program to bring in these aspects of those pillars of the thriving life that I talked about
into our other other programs or fly fishing programs and things like that.
problem that we're facing is huge. There's 1.7 million post-911 combat veterans.
You know, 74,000 have been wounded physically. Over 700,000 have experienced symptoms of PTSD.
And PTSD isn't something that you get healed from. It's a matter of managing those symptoms and being
members that volunteered right after 9-11, stayed in the military for their entire career 20 years
plus in a time of war. Those 200,000 are getting ready to come out now too and we've got to be
Waters Foundation achieve its full potential and help veterans thrive. That's number one.
Number two is making sure that my kids are thriving. My older sons graduating here in about a week
and going to Montesda University to get an engineering degree and really supporting him in
every way that I can with that. Helping my younger son Gabe figure out what that looks like for him
different kid than his brother and has a different interest in really trying to help him
form a pretty good idea of what that's like for him. And that's something that I didn't have when I,
to a couple of wrestling camps at the Naval Academy when we were out on the East Coast just to expose
him to that place. And I've talked to him about ROTC and things like that, but he is zero interest
from MSU. Then he's going to go to Embry Riddle and get a master's degree in aerospace engineering.
And then he's going to work for NASA. That's what he wants to do. He's focused. Gabe,
Gabe has showed some inclination towards potentially the military and I'll take the same
If he decides to do it, then I'm going to push him to special operations route because I want to
great husband to my wife as much as I can and then trying to be a positive force in the community
in any way that I can. I mean, like I said, that's service and leadership. That's where I find my,
that's where I find my purpose. So, yeah, that can manifest itself in a ton of different ways.
Yeah, just keep fighting. Yep. Yep. Well, Brian, I always enjoy spending time with you
almost more than anyone and just your presence brings a special thing. And I think every time
you walk in the gym or in the room without you even saying anything, you just make people
better. You have that special part of you. You make people more focused, work harder.
I think characterizes when you walk in the room before you even say one word. And I've always
humbled for the opportunity. And thank you. I appreciate it. You're much too kind. Thank you.
that speaks volumes in terms of your own character, your commitment to helping people,
you know, be ready for anything. So, thank you. Yeah, you bet. Thank you. Yep. Awesome. Thanks,
Brad. Thanks, brother. Appreciate it.
